C_03_PROLOGUE,"[i]In the frozen trenches of Hoth, you fight valiantly to buy time for Echo Base to be evacuated. You can only watch as the shield generator is destroyed by the overwhelming Imperial AT-AT assault. You scramble to reach your transport, but the Empire breaks the Rebel lines and cuts off your escape. In the ensuing skirmish, your commander gives his life covering your retreat into the mountains.

In the days following the battle, a new Imperial general takes charge of hunting down survivors like yourselves. Separated from the rest of the Rebellion and running low on supplies, you plan a risky incursion back into Echo Base, now under Imperial control, to look for a way to rejoin the fleet....[/i]"

""I can't feel my toes anymore,"" says Corporal Kish. You crossed paths with Kish and his superior officer, Lieutenant Talcon, a couple of days back. They had also been left behind in the evacuation. ""I don't know how much farther I can go,"" Kish adds.[/i]"
M_31_INTRO_2,"[i]""Keep moving those legs, soldier,"" says Talcon, a human female and the highest ranking officer in your small group of Rebels. She stops and turns to {0}. ""Take point for a while.""

As you continue to trudge forward, Talcon waits a moment to let Kish catch up. ""We're nearly at the trench line,"" she says with a reassuring pat on Kish's shoulder. ""We might be able to find a heater there to thaw us out a bit.""[/i]"

CAM_3_EPILOGUE_VICTORY,"[i]Haven hosts a victory feast that lasts deep into the night. The villagers eat, drink, sing, and even teach you to dance a local jig. You had worried they would blame you for the danger, but Benex leads the toast to celebrate you as their defenders.\n
In the morning, you finally reestablish contact with the Rebellion and send your summary report to Alliance Command. They suggest you take some time to heal your wounds before returning to battle and you can't think of any better place to rest than right where you are.\n
The long winter gives way to a beautiful mountain spring. Your adventures continue, but you never forget the sunrises, crisp air, and sweet flowers of Haven.[/i]"
CAM_3_EPILOGUE_VICTORY_NO_BENEX,"[i]Haven hosts a victory feast that lasts deep into the night. The villagers set a place of honor for their still-missing leader, Benex. You had worried the people would blame you, but they choose to celebrate you as their defenders.\n

CAM_3_EPILOGUE_DEFEAT_1,"[i]Haven is reduced to ash as the Empire uses the rustic village as target practice. Or at least that's what your interrogator tells you, though he gives you no reason to doubt him.\n
""I suppose I should thank you,"" General Sorin offers with a cruel grin. ""You've shown me the weaknesses my simulations failed to reveal. Because of you, the new Mark III Repulsor Tank will be unstoppable!""\n
On the last day before your 'trial,' the general returns to your cell. ""You will be happy to know that I have been promoted,"" Sorin taunts. ""Your comrades have no idea how to stop my new tanks. Though truthfully, I don't know if they can be stopped. The end of your Rebellion is at hand.""[/i]"
CAM_3_EPILOGUE_DEFEAT_2,"[i]You retreat into the woods and make camp. The usually starry sky billows with smoke as Haven burns in the distance. You hope the villagers made it to safety, but you don't know the terrain well enough to know where they might have headed.\n
The Rebellion is much safer now that Sorin is gone, but you still toss and turn in your wintry sleep. If you can't protect one mountain village, will you be able to protect the galaxy?[/i]"
