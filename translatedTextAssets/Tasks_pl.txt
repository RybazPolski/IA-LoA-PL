ENCOUNTER_09_DESC,"[i]Captain Darpik, commanding officer of the Rebel transport [/i]Freedom Fighter[i], has requested a meeting.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_09_1,"[i]Your orders following the evacuation of Yavin base are to escort the Rebel transport [/i]Freedom Fighter[i] to an Alliance rendezvous. After several hyperspace jumps to throw the Empire off your trail, you meet the ship's commanding officer, Captain Darpik, aboard the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i]'s makeshift command center.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_09_2,"[i]Captain Darpik is a pale-skinned Mon Calamari.{0} ""I’m glad to have you along for security,"" Darpik says after you introduce yourselves to her. ""We’re not really outfitted for independent operations. I will feel better knowing you will be watching our backs.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_09_2_LOKU," She warmly greets Loku when she sees him."
ENCOUNTER_09_2A,"We’re happy to be of assistance."
ENCOUNTER_09_2B,"Isn't there something more important for us to do?"
ENCOUNTER_09_2B_2,"[i]""I understand how you feel,"" Darpik says, not showing any indication of having taken offense at your reply. ""But keeping an army supplied is vital to keeping it fighting. Without the resources we carry, you won't last long against the Empire.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_09_3,"[i]""Our first order of business is to pick up some foodstuffs,"" Darpik says. ""We’re carrying more passengers than usual, so we will need extra supplies. I know a small port on Ord Mantell where we should be able to go undetected, but I have something other than a grocery run in mind for you.""\n\n""Commander Ginn is the senior Alliance Army officer aboard, and he is taking a team to Ord Mantell to extract operatives whose location has been compromised. He could use your skills.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_09_3A,"Whatever we can do to help."
ENCOUNTER_09_3B,"Sounds like fun."
ENCOUNTER_09_4,"[i]""Good,"" Darpik responds with a grateful nod. ""I’ll let you return to your ship to get ready. Commander Ginn will meet you there in 20 minutes. May the Force be with you.""[/i]"
TASK_10_NAME,"The Smuggler Sidestep"
TASK_10_DESC,"[i]Command needs volunteers to help recover assets that may be in danger now that the Empire has flushed out the base on\nYavin 4.[/i]"

TASK_10_2,"[i]You find Commander Ares Ginn at your ship, checking the firing mechanism on an A280 blaster rifle with the exacting efficiency of an Imperial Academy graduate. ""You must be the extra set of hands I was promised,"" he says. ""I heard you gave the Empire a good fight on\nYavin 4.""[/i]"
TASK_10_PLAYER_2A,"We did our best, sir."
TASK_10_PLAYER_2B,"Hardly a challenge."
TASK_10_3B,"[i]""I’d stow that attitude,"" Ares says. ""The Empire may not believe in quality, but quantity is something they understand very precisely.""[/i]"
TASK_10_3,"[i]You follow Ares aboard the freighter. Two more figures sit at the controls. ""Corporal Calle Tharandon,"" Ares says, motioning toward the man in the copilot’s seat. ""Quartermaster. His brain contains the most exact record of the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i]’s manifest, down to the last blaster pack.""[/i]"
TASK_10_PLAYER_3A,"You’ve got quite the memory."
TASK_10_PLAYER_3B,"Yeah? How many do we have?"
TASK_10_4A,"[i]Calle shrugs broadly. ""I don’t want to brag. I do use a datapad sometimes.""[/i]"
TASK_10_4B,"[i]Calle shrugs broadly. ""Ares makes it sound like more than it is. I still have to use a datapad from time to time. But since you asked, we have ninety-three blaster packs."" The quartermaster conspicuously does not consult a datapad.[/i]"
TASK_10_5,"[i]""And this is Burin Kassal, our pilot."" Ares says. The man in the pilot’s seat gives little indication that he even knows he’s the subject of the conversation as he punches astrogation data into the ship’s navicomputer. ""He’s an expert at slipping past Imperial patrol craft.""[/i]"
TASK_10_PLAYER_5A,"Impressive."
TASK_10_PLAYER_5B,"Sounds like you’ve hauled some contraband."
TASK_10_6A,"[i]""It’s not that hard once you know how their sensor arcs overlap,"" Burin says as he guides the ship into hyperspace.[/i]"
TASK_10_6B,"[i]""Enough to make a living,"" Burin answers.\n\nCalle claps him on the shoulder. ""He’s being modest. Burin was one of the best smugglers in the sector.""[/i]"
TASK_10_7,"[i]You drop out of hyperspace near Ord Mantell. An Imperial light cruiser looms large in your viewport.\n\n""Security looks tighter than usual,"" Ares observes. ""Steady as she goes.""[/i]"
TASK_10_8,"[i]""Here we go,"" Calle says, almost eagerly.\n\nBurin grumbles at the quartermaster's attitude. ""They’ve dropped a new sensor net. Too tight to get through. I’m turning us around."" The pilot grips the controls. ""We might be able to spoof the transponder and get through later, but that will take time.""[/i]"
TASK_10_PLAYER_8A,"Keep an eye on the scopes and escape."
TASK_10_PLAYER_8B,"Try to spoof your transponder right now."
TASK_10_TEST_INS,"[i]You watch the freighter’s sensor scopes closely, keeping a sharp eye on the cruiser’s sensor net.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_10_TEST_TEC,"[i]You pop open a maintenance panel to access the ship’s transponder. This is a complex process, rarely executed in the heat of the moment.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_10_END_1_SUCCESS_1,"[i]You help Burin guide the ship through the Imperial sensor net. The pilot makes the tiniest adjustments to the ship’s course, taking the ship safely back to hyperspace.[/i]"
TASK_10_END_1_SUCCESS_2,"[i]""The Empire was more prepared than we thought. We’ll need to be careful from here on,"" Ares says when you return to the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i]. The officer turns to you. ""Your assistance was appreciated. Don’t dwell on having to abort the mission. We can’t take unnecessary risks right now.""\n\nGetting your ship to safety despite the unexpected Imperial presence in the system has proven your value to the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i].[/i]\n\nYou gained 10 fame."
TASK_10_END_1_FAIL_1,"[i]You alert Burin when it looks like you’re getting to close to the sensor net, but your warning comes too late. ""CORT-327, power down and prepare for inspection,"" an officious Imperial voice says over the comms.\n\n""Get us out of here,"" Ares orders, and Burin swings the ship around and jumps to lightspeed before the Imperials start shooting.[/i]"
TASK_10_END_1_FAIL_2,"[i]""The Empire was more prepared than we thought. We’ll need to be careful from here on,"" Ares says when you return to the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i]. ""I’ll report to Captain Darpik. Once we rendezvous with the fleet I’ll see if I can get you time in a simulator to bone up on your skills.""\n\nThough the outcome of the mission was unfortunate, you remained cool under fire and did what you could—valuable traits in a soldier.[/i]\n\nYou gained 5 fame."
TASK_10_END_2_SUCCESS_1,"[i]You plug a datapad into the ship’s transponder; detailed data flows across the screen. You make some quick changes to transmit a false code.\n\nAn officious Imperial voice comes over the ship’s comms. ""Unidentified freighter, reduce speed and prepare for—"" He pauses for a chilling moment. ""Go ahead, CORT-327. Be advised, your transponder is transmitting on a delay.""[/i]"
TASK_10_END_2_SUCCESS_2,"[i]You reach the safehouse on Ord Mantell. The operatives there are glad to see you, as the Empire has been searching the area for hours. As you load the supplies the operatives gathered, Calle sets a small supply case aside. ""That was a heck of a stunt you pulled,"" he says. ""I could hear Ares grinding his teeth, but you’ve earned this.""[/i]\n\nYou gained 1 medpac for your next mission. You gained 15 fame."
TASK_10_END_2_FAIL_1,"[i]You plug a datapad into the ship’s transponder, and detailed data flows across the screen. You make some quick changes, but your datapad’s screen starts to blink red; you’ve tripped a BoSS security program.[/i]"
TASK_10_END_2_FAIL_2,"[i]An officious Imperial voice comes over the ship’s comms. ""Unidentified freighter, reduce speed and prepare to be boarded, or you will be fired upon.""\n\nAres sets his jaw. ""Get away from that panel!"" the officer snaps at you. ""No chance of getting to the planet now. Get us out of here,"" he tells Burin. You escape to hyperspace moments ahead of Imperial laser fire.\n\nYour actions endangered your mission and your ship. Your reputation suffers from this mistake.[/i]\n\nYou lost 5 fame."
TASK_10_REWARD_FAME_1,"You gained 10 fame."
TASK_10_REWARD_FAME_2,"You gained 5 fame."
TASK_10_REWARD_SUPPLY,"You gained 1 medpac. You gained 15 fame."
TASK_10_PENALTY_FAME,"You lost 5 fame."
TASK_11_NAME,"Taking Sides"
TASK_11_DESC,"[i]Raised voices draw you toward the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i]’s equipment bay.[/i]"

TASK_11_1,"[i]You arrive to see Commander Ares Ginn and Corporal Calle Tharandon exchanging heated words.\n\n""Your men had one job,"" Calle says, gesturing emphatically. ""I didn’t ask for power converters because I like them. I asked for power converters because we need them if we're going to be ready when the Empire catches up with us.""\n\n""We lost a lot of good people between Scarif and Yavin,"" Ares says. The commander's voice is a low growl, but he seems perfectly calm by comparison to the quartermaster. ""We can’t take any risks with what few personnel we have.""[/i]"
TASK_11_PLAYER_1A,"We need to protect our people!"
TASK_11_PLAYER_1B,"We need to be prepared to fight!"
TASK_11_PLAYER_1C,"Stay out of this."
TASK_11_TEST_INS,"[i]You approach, standing alongside Commander Ginn.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_11_TEST_STR,"[i]You approach, standing alongside Corporal Tharandon.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_11_2A_1,"[i]You tell Corporal Tharandon that the Rebellion’s greatest military asset is its people. A life outweighs an X-wing or a hyperdrive.\n\n""I will try to get you what you need,"" Ares says, his tone firm as durasteel. ""But we take targets of opportunity. It’s your job to make the most of what we’re able to get.""\n\nCalle opens his mouth to protest, but Ares heads him off. ""You have your orders, Corporal.""[/i]"
TASK_11_2A_2,"[i]Calle slams a fist against a bulkhead as he wheels around and heads back to his duty station. Ares turns to you.\n\n""I appreciate the show of solidarity,"" he says. ""These are difficult times, and not everyone has the training to handle it. There’s a reason the Imperial war machine works."" He looks back in Calle’s direction, his gaze lingering for just long enough to feel oppressive. ""Let me know the next time you’re assigned to head into the field. I’ll give you what recon my people have gathered.""[/i]"
TASK_11_2B_1,"[i]You tell Commander Ginn that nobody joined the Rebellion because they thought it would be a safe life choice.\n\n""The Empire can play it safe if it wants to,"" Calle says. ""We can’t. If we dodge every danger we see, we’ve already lost.""\n\nAres stews for a moment. He has the advantage of rank, but in the Alliance, the chain of command is sometimes more of a guideline than a rule. ""We’ve got another recon mission scheduled in six hours,"" he finally says. ""I’ll make a point to tell the squad leader what you need.""[/i]"
TASK_11_2B_2,"[i]Ares stalks away. Calle turns to you, jaw set, but looking like he’s already cooling down. ""Thanks for backing me up,"" he says. ""I know he hates to lose people. Everybody hates to lose people, but I’ve seen what happens when you try to wait out the Empire.""\n\nCalle picks up a datapad and hands it to you. ""Ares will be upset if he finds out I’m sharing mission intel around, but I think you could use this.""[/i]"
TASK_11_2C_1,"[i]The argument escalates beyond your ability to intervene.\n\n""Where’s the risk? Power converters fall like rain at Imperial garrisons!"" Calle says, louder than before. ""Not to mention stormtroopers can’t—""[/i]"
TASK_11_2C_2,"[i]""You are out of line!"" Ares roars. The whole of the bay goes silent as heads turn to watch the scene that most of the crew had been pretending to ignore. ""I am not going to tell you how to do your job. You do not tell me how to do mine."" Each furious word is tinged with the faint remnants of a Core World accent. ""Is that clear?""\n\n""Yes, sir,"" Calle bites out. ""Crystal."" He turns to return to his work, and Ares leaves the equipment bay. If you didn’t know better, you’d think someone had turned up the gravity.[/i]"
TASK_11_PLAYER_2,"Well, that could have gone better."
TASK_11_PLAYER_3,"Well, that could have gone worse."
TASK_11_REWARD,"Heroes receive the ""Rebel Recon"" Reward card."
TASK_12_NAME,"Hintaro"
TASK_12_DESC,"[i]You are invited to unwind with some of the crew.[/i]"

TASK_12_1A,"[i]You arrive at the modular container that has been repurposed as a recreation room for the crew of the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i]. Ares Ginn, Calle Tharandon, and Burin Kassal are already seated around a table consisting of a scored sheet of Y-wing plating set on top of a battered crate. Commander Ginn is just rising to leave.\n\n""Can I convince you to stay for another game, Commander?"" Calle says.\n\nAres shakes his head. ""No, I prefer if my entertainment pretends I’m in control of my own fate.""\n\n""They don’t play hintaro at the Academy?""[/i]"
TASK_12_1B,"[i]Ares bristles. ""No. Cadets aren’t allowed to gamble. No one risks a reprimand for anything less than sabacc."" He rubs his chin, mouth set in a contemplative frown, perhaps recalling some time he risked reprimand and lost. ""Now, if you’ll excuse me…""\n\nYou enter the rec room and sit across the table from Calle and Burin. A set of chance cubes sit in the middle of the table, meticulously arranged into a pyramid. ""You know hintaro?” he asks.[/i]"
TASK_12_PLAYER_1A,"Not really."
TASK_12_PLAYER_1B,"I prefer sabacc."
TASK_12_2A_1,"[i]Burin passes two chance cubes to each player, himself included, and explains the rules: you roll, you wager, and then you can roll again if you don’t like your odds against everyone else’s results. After each player has rerolled, a final chance cube, the hintaron, is rolled to determine the winner.[/i]"
TASK_12_2A_2,"[i]Everyone antes into the pot, and chance cubes are rolled. Calle rolls a low[/i] kulro kulro[i], showing only . Burin, however, rolls a solid[/i] tukar tukar[i] with . Deciding he doesn’t like his odds, Calle folds, while Burin raises the stakes.[/i]\n\nEach hero rolls 2 blue dice. After rolling, each hero may reroll 1 die.\n\nAfter each hero has rerolled (or chosen not to), roll 1 white die as the hintaron. Each  result cancels 1 from every player’s pool, and each  result cancels 1 from every player’s pool. Treat  as blank.\n\nThe player with the most  results has the high roll. The player with the most  results wins ties.\n\nWho has the high roll?"
TASK_12_2B_1,"[i]""We don’t play that. Burin here’s a card shark.""\n\n""The fact that I know the odds of any given outcome does not mean I cheat,"" Burin protests as he gathers up the chance cubes.\n\nHe passes two chance cubes to each player, himself included, and explains the rules: you roll, you wager, and then you can roll again if you don’t like your odds against everyone else’s results. Simple enough.[/i]"
TASK_12_PLAYER_2A,"A hero has the high roll."
TASK_12_PLAYER_2B,"Burin has the high roll."
TASK_12_2AA,"[i]You win 50 credits off of Burin and Calle. Hintaro might not be so bad![/i]\n\nYou gained 50 credits."
TASK_12_2AB,"[i]You and Burin split the pot. That’s 25 credits in your pocket![/i]\n\nYou gained 25 credits."
TASK_12_3A,"[i]You play hintaro long into the night, taking a few pots and losing others. By the time fatigue starts setting in, you’re doing well enough that both Calle and Burin have nearly run out of credits to bet. Calle is resigned to his fate, but Burin, with quiet fervor, is not ready to give up.\n\n""One moment,"" he says, rising and leaving the room. A few minutes later, he returns with a sealed case. Faded lettering on it reads ""adrenal implant.""[/i]"
TASK_12_3B,"[i]""Where in the Rim did you get that?"" Calle asks.\n\n""It’s been in my cargo hold for years. The Whiphid that hired me to smuggle it out of the Corporate Sector never paid up."" He looks over at you. ""That was before my Rebel days. So what do you say? Double or nothing?"""
TASK_12_PLAYER_3A,"You're on."
TASK_12_3C,"[i]Burin rolls. His dice show a mediocre result with . He looks unhappy with the result. He looks to you; it is your turn to decide if you wish to reroll one of your own dice before he must choose.[/i]\n\nEach hero rolls 2 blue dice. After rolling, each hero may reroll 1 die."
TASK_12_PLAYER_3B,"Your turn, Burin."
TASK_12_4,"[i]Not liking his odds even against the hintaron alone, Burin takes one of his dice. ""Here we go."" He rerolls...and receives , leaving him with a stronger . Happier with this, he pushes the hintaron over to you. This roll will decide the winner.[/i]\n\nRoll 1 white die as the hintaron. Each  result cancels 1 from every player’s pool, and each  result cancels 1 from every player’s pool. Treat  as blank.\n\nThe player with the most  results has the high roll. The player with the most  results wins ties.\n\nWho has the high roll?"
TASK_12_PLAYER_4C,"A hero is tied with Burin for the high roll."
TASK_12_5A,"[i]Calle lets out a barking chuckle. ""It’s about time someone beat you at this,"" he says, clapping Burin on the back.\n\nBurin looks sheepish, but pushes the adrenal implant across the table to you. ""Fair and square,"" he says.[/i]"
TASK_12_5B,"[i]Burin lets out a breath you hadn’t realized he was holding. He takes the adrenal implant off the table, and you give him his credits back. The ones you won off Calle still make up for your own losses, at least.\n\n""He’s the best,"" Calle says with a shrug. ""You didn’t stand a chance.""[/i]"
TASK_12_5C,"[i]In hintaro, tied pots are split. However, it is hard to split an adrenal implant.\n\n""It’s yours,"" says Burin, pushing it across the table. ""It will just collect dust for a few more years if you don’t take it.""[/i]"
TASK_12_PLAYER_5A,"Pleasure doing business with you."
TASK_12_REWARD,"Heroes receive the ""Adrenal Implant"" Reward card."
TASK_14_NAME,"Moving On"
TASK_14_DESC,"[i]The crew of the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i] is still reeling from recent events.[/i]"

TASK_14_1,"[i]You return to the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i] to find the ship in a flurry of activity. The captain has pressed every crew member and passenger into sweeping the ship for trackers, or anything else {0} might have left behind.\n\nYou’re still weary from your encounter on Felucia, but you join the crew in their efforts. The sooner the captain is sure the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i] can’t be followed, the sooner you can rejoin the Rebel fleet.[/i]"
TASK_14_FIND_ARES,"[i]You find Ares giving orders to the crew with his usual practiced efficiency. While most of the crew is frantic, he is operating as if nothing were out of the ordinary.[/i]"
TASK_14_FIND_BURIN,"[i]You find Burin on his back beneath a sand-blasted T-47 airspeeder, a common sight in the Alliance’s vehicular arsenal. You hear him banging a spanner against the speeder’s repulsor casing.[/i]"
TASK_14_FIND_CALLE,"[i]You find Calle coordinating the crew’s efforts. He shouts direction with the fluidity of a master auctioneer.[/i]"
TASK_14_TALK_ARES,"How can we help, Commander?"
TASK_14_TALK_BURIN,"Broke something?"
TASK_14_TALK_CALLE,"How can we help, Corporal?"
TASK_14_A_2,"[i]Burin slides out from under the speeder. He sets his spanner on the deck. ""I’m a little distracted,"" he explains. ""I’m just trying to occupy myself.""[/i]"
TASK_14_A_PLAYER_2,"Because of Ares?"
TASK_14_A_3,"[i]""I’m not sure what anyone expected from a former Imperial."" He moves to sit on the sloping front of the T-47. ""I think the captain is keeping me at arm’s length, too. The stink of suspicion and everything.""[/i]"
TASK_14_A_PLAYER_3A,"You’re right. Former Imperials can’t be trusted."
TASK_14_A_PLAYER_3B,"Trust goes both ways."
TASK_14_A_4A,"[i]""And here I thought you were blind optimists."" Burin’s lips turn up in a grim facsimile of a smile. ""I guess any tooka can learn new tricks. Excuse me."" He pushes past you.[/i]"
TASK_14_A_4B,"[i]""There’s a middle ground between pragmatism and blind optimism."" Burin’s voice is an icy wind. ""Excuse me."" He pushes past you.[/i]"
TASK_14_A_5,"[i]""Burin, where are you..."" Calle’s words trail off when Burin doesn’t slow his pace. ""Is that about Ares?"" Calle asks you, angling a thumb in Burin’s direction.[/i]"
TASK_14_A_PLAYER_5,"Burin’s not taking it well."
TASK_14_A_6,"[i]""No one is,"" Calle says. ""We’ve all lost people in this war, but this is worse somehow."" He looks down at his datapad, unfocused eyes skimming over the screen. ""Betrayal leaves a lot of unanswered questions.”\n\nThe loss of composure is brief. ""But we’ve got the Empire on the run. They’re scared. And we can make them pay for this.""\n\nHe’s already walking away before he turns, remembering one last thing. ""Ares left a few things behind. I can make sure a little extra is set aside for you. Somebody has to take the fight to the Empire!""[/i]\n\nYou gain 100 credits!"
TASK_14_AB_2,"[i]Calle studies his datapad. ""We still haven’t had anyone check the T-47s in the aft section. Their repulsors could hide a tracker pretty well."" You notice Calle avoiding eye contact.[/i]"
TASK_14_AB_PLAYER_2A,"Sorry about Ares."
TASK_14_AB_PLAYER_2B,"Sorry about Burin."
TASK_14_AB_3A,"[i]Calle sighs, but breaks into the kind of smile one hides behind. ""I thought he was one of the good ones,"" he says.[/i]"
TASK_14_AB_3B,"[i]""I’m sure you did what you could,"" Calle lies.[/i]"
TASK_14_AB_PLAYER_3,"You seem to be coping well."
TASK_14_AB_4,"[i]""No one is, really,"" Calle says. ""You learn to compartmentalize."" He looks down at his datapad, unfocused eyes skimming over its screen. ""Betrayal leaves a lot of unanswered questions.”""\n\nHe taps his datapad a few times. ""Look, I’m sorry to brush you off, but we’ve still got a lot of ship to inspect before the captain feels safe to head to the rendezvous point.""[/i]"
TASK_14_AB_PLAYER_4A,"We’ll check those speeders."
TASK_14_AB_PLAYER_4B,"After all this is over, maybe we should grab a caf."
TASK_14_AB_5A,"[i]""Thanks."" He turns his attention to a technician sweeping a scanner over refrigerated storage containers. ""Careful with those! The circuits are finicky."" And then he’s moved on, leaving the ship feeling emptier than when you arrived.[/i]"
TASK_14_AB_5B,"[i]Calle shakes his head. ""I don’t think so."" He turns his attention to a technician sweeping a scanner over refrigerated storage containers. ""Careful with those! The circuits are finicky."" And then he’s moved on, leaving the ship feeling emptier than when you arrived.[/i]"
TASK_14_AC_5,"[i]Then, Burin stops. ""If you ask me,"" he says, ""this whole cause is living on borrowed time. Everyone is worried that one man might have doomed the entire Rebellion. How long do you think this is going to last?""[/i]"
TASK_14_AC_PLAYER_5A,"As long as it needs to. If not us, someone else."
TASK_14_AC_PLAYER_5B,"The Empire’s scared. We’ve got a chance."
TASK_14_AC_6,"[i]""And what happens the next time the Empire builds a Death Star? We got lucky because some kid’s a good shot."" Burin shakes his head. ""I don’t like those odds. I’m leaving, and I recommend you do the same. With your skills you could make good money running spice or bounty hunting.""[/i]"
TASK_14_AC_PLAYER_6A,"You’re turning on the Rebellion? Just like Ares?"
TASK_14_AC_PLAYER_6B,"Sorry we couldn’t save Calle."
TASK_14_AC_7A,"[i]""If you really think that’s a fair comparison."" He holds out a hand. ""If you change your mind, look me up on Ord Mantell. Until then, good luck.""[/i]"
TASK_14_AC_7B,"[i]""I don’t blame you. I blame Ares. I even blame Calle. But that doesn’t change anything."" He holds out a hand. ""If you change your mind, you can find me on Ord Mantell. Until then, good luck.""[/i]"
TASK_14_AC_PLAYER_7A,"Shake his hand."
TASK_14_AC_PLAYER_7B,"Don’t shake his hand."
TASK_14_AC_8A,"[i]Burin grips your hand firmly. He doesn’t say anything more; he just turns on his heel and moves on.[/i]"
TASK_14_AC_8B,"[i]Disappointment crosses Burin’s face. ""Alright."" He doesn’t say anything more; he just turns on his heel and moves on.[/i]"
TASK_14_B_2,"[i]Calle studies his datapad. ""We still haven’t had anyone check the T-47s in the aft section, I don’t think. Or..."" He taps through his datapad, muttering. ""Where is it? I know I made this checklist somewhere.""[/i]"
TASK_14_B_PLAYER_2,"Is what happened with Burin bothering you?"
TASK_14_B_3,"[i]""I [/i]trusted[i] him,"" Calle snarls. He presses his fists down on a crate, arms and shoulders taut. ""That double-crossing, no-good...""[/i]"
TASK_14_B_PLAYER_3A,"Step in."
TASK_14_B_PLAYER_3B,"Let him vent."
TASK_14_B_4A,"[i]You lay a hand on his shoulder. You feel Calle relax, if only marginally. ""Sorry. Burin and I go way back. I can’t stand the thought that he might have been against me the whole time.""[/i]"
TASK_14_B_4B,"[i]Calle slams his fist against an upright storage container as hard as he can, then reels back in pain. ""That,"" he concludes, ""was a terrible idea."" He clutches his hand, a bruise slowly forming. ""Sorry. Burin and I go way back. I can’t stand the thought that he might have been against me the whole time.""[/i]"
TASK_14_B_5,"[i]Ares approaches, having heard the commotion. ""Corporal, I suggest you take a break,"" he says to Calle. ""Cool off. Have some caf."" Calle nods, hands his datapad to Ares, and heads to the mess.[/i]"
TASK_14_B_PLAYER_5,"Calle’s not taking it well."
TASK_14_B_6,"[i]""He and Burin were close. After a while, that’s unavoidable."" Ares starts to peruse Calle’s datapad. ""Still, despite appearances, he’s not letting it affect his work. And he’s one of the best people we have on this ship. People like Calle give the Alliance a chance.""\n\nAres sounds even more measured than usual. His Core World accent is stronger, too. “""We all want to make sure the Empire pays for this,"" he says. “”I'll make sure you’ve got some extra supplies when you leave.””[/i]\n\nYou gain 100 credits!"
TASK_14_BC_2,"[i]Ares consults his datapad. ""It looks like there are some T-47s that need a thorough inspection. Kassal would know that their repulsor coils could help conceal a tracker.""[/i]"
TASK_14_BC_PLAYER_2A,"Sorry about Burin."
TASK_14_BC_PLAYER_2B,"Sorry about Calle."
TASK_14_BC_3A,"[i]""I did not interact with him much,"" Ares says. ""Unsurprisingly, we didn’t have much in common. Still, he was an asset, and for a time I was proud to call him one of my own."" He raises an eyebrow. ""His treachery was unexpected, at least.""[/i]"
TASK_14_BC_3B,"[i]""There are always casualties in war,"" Ares says, a little too impassively. ""I’ve learned not to become too attached, especially with the Alliance. We are a team, not a family."" For the briefest of moments you see something else: sadness? Sympathy? ""Still...Corporal Tharandon was an excellent soldier. We did not always see eye to eye, but I respected him for it.""[/i]"
TASK_14_BC_PLAYER_3,"How did this happen?"
TASK_14_BC_4,"[i]Ares somehow finds a way to straighten his stance even more. ""The Empire teaches that fear is a powerful motivator. At Imperial academies, you are taught to use it as a weapon, but you are also often the target of such a weapon. I suspect Burin fell prey to this tactic, one way or the other.""\n\nAres focuses on his datapad again. ""We have a war to fight. There will be a time and a place to count our dead.""[/i]"
TASK_14_BC_PLAYER_4A,"We’ll check those speeders."
TASK_14_BC_PLAYER_4B,"After all this is over, maybe we should grab a caf."
TASK_14_BC_5A,"[i]Ares nods curtly, which seems a sufficient goodbye in his opinion. He moves on to assess the crew’s progress on other tasks, leaving the ship feeling emptier than when you arrived.[/i]"
TASK_14_BC_5B,"[i]Ares chuckles, which is something you weren’t aware he could do. ""Yes, maybe so. I think I have a sabacc deck somewhere as well."" He nods curtly, which seems a sufficient goodbye in his opinion. He moves on to assess the crew’s progress on other tasks, leaving the ship feeling emptier than when you arrived.[/i]"
TASK_14_BA_5,"[i]That’s when you notice new rank pins on Calle’s uniform: no longer a corporal, but a lieutenant. Such a jump in a short span of time is impressive.[/i]"
TASK_14_BA_PLAYER_5A,"Congratulations on the promotion, Lieutenant."
TASK_14_BA_PLAYER_5B,"You’ve been assigned to take over Ares’s role?"
TASK_14_BA_6,"[i]Calle shrugs broadly. ""It’s not how I wanted to get it,"" he admits. ""Ares and I didn’t see eye to eye often, but...he kept us honest."" He removes the pin and runs his fingers over it. ""The captain said Ares left her a recommendation that, if he were incapacitated, I should take his place.""[/i]"
TASK_14_BA_PLAYER_6A,"You’ll be an excellent officer."
TASK_14_BA_PLAYER_6B,"That sounds daunting."
TASK_14_BA_7A,"[i]""Thanks for your vote of confidence."" Calle lets out a breath. ""It’s the kind of thing Burin would usually help me cope with, at first. I like systems. I like lists. This is all too unexpected.""[/i]"
TASK_14_BA_7B,"[i]""It is,"" Calle agrees. ""It’s the kind of thing Burin would usually help me cope with, at first. I like systems. I like lists. This is all too unexpected.""[/i]"
TASK_14_BA_PLAYER_7A,"Salute."
TASK_14_BA_PLAYER_7B,"Clap him on the shoulder."
TASK_14_BA_8A,"[i]Calle laughs. ""Okay, please don’t do that yet. At least let me get through this current crisis first."" He moves on to take charge again, but you think his step is lighter than before.[/i]"
TASK_14_BA_8B,"[i]Calle tenses a bit. ""I should really get back to work,"" he says, replacing his new rank pin. ""I have to go at least look like an officer."" He moves on to take charge again.[/i]"
TASK_14_C_2,"[i]Ares consults his datapad. ""It looks like there are some T-47s that need a thorough inspection. Corporal Tharandon would know that their repulsor coils could help conceal a tracker.""[/i]"
TASK_14_C_PLAYER_2,"Are you taking over for Calle?"
TASK_14_C_3,"[i]""For the moment. We’ll eventually need to assign a new quartermaster, but there isn’t anyone available who has the requisite skills."" He waves the datapad. ""We can’t even be sure this manifest is correct. Corporal Tharandon may well have falsified parts of it.""[/i]"
TASK_14_C_PLAYER_3A,"Someone will need to check everything."
TASK_14_C_PLAYER_3B,"That sounds a little extreme, don’t you think?"
TASK_14_C_4A,"[i]""It would be a minor hindrance to us, all told, but that’s still time we’d have to waste. And I think Corporal Tharandon knew enough to make it as much of a hindrance as possible."" Ares sets his jaw. ""There is much to do and little time to do it."" He nods curtly, which seems a sufficient goodbye in his opinion.[/i]"
TASK_14_C_4B,"[i]""No. It would be a minor hindrance to us, all told, but that’s still time we’d have to waste. And I think Corporal Tharandon knew enough to make it as much of a hindrance as possible."" Ares sets his jaw. ""There is much to do and little time to do it."" He nods curtly, which seems a sufficient goodbye in his opinion.[/i]"
TASK_14_C_5,"[i]""Glad you made it back."" Burin appears from around a stack of crates. ""You can’t tell, but Ares is glad you made it back, too.""[/i]"
TASK_14_C_PLAYER_5,"Ares isn’t taking it well."
TASK_14_C_6,"[i]""I think he really trusted Calle,"" Burin says. ""I did, too, as much as I trust anyone. That’ll teach me."" Burin’s nonchalance contrasts with his normal exactitude. ""We’re shipping out as soon as we can,"" he says, already on his way to wherever he normally lurks. “”I have a bit of extra cargo that I’ll make sure to accidentally leave in your hold. Show the Empire they can’t get away with this.””[/i]\n\nYou gain 100 credits!"
TASK_14_CA_2,"[i]Burin slides out from under the speeder. He sets his spanner on the deck. ""I’m a little distracted,"" he explains. ""I’m just trying to occupy myself.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CA_PLAYER_2A,"Because of Calle?"
TASK_14_CA_PLAYER_2B,"Because of Ares?"
TASK_14_CA_3A,"[i]""Because of Calle,"" Burin says, testing the words. ""He’s the reason I’m here. I was going to leave the Rebellion, but he convinced me that staying was worth it.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CA_3B,"[i]""Ares was a soldier. He knew what he was getting into."" Burin’s tone sounds less callous than his words, but only a little. ""Calle was closer to Ares than I was. I don’t have many connections here.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CA_PLAYER_3,"Are you saying you’re going to leave?"
TASK_14_CA_4,"[i]""The thought’s crossed my mind,"" Burin admits. ""I don’t like the Alliance’s odds. Too many moving parts. And one man can endanger everything, it turns out."" He hands the spanner to you. ""Can you finish checking these things?"" he asks, indicating the speeders. ""I need some caf.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CA_PLAYER_4A,"Sure, we’ll check the speeders."
TASK_14_CA_PLAYER_4B,"After all this is over, maybe we should get a caf."
TASK_14_CA_5A,"[i]""Thank you,"" Burin manages as he wanders away. You watch him move on, but you can’t shake the feeling he’s not the same as he was.[/i]"
TASK_14_CA_5B,"[i]""Maybe. If I’m still around."" Burin wanders away, and his tone suggests that that caf isn’t likely to happen. If he’s leaving the [/i]Freedom Fighter[i], he’ll need to go while you’re still near Ithor. You watch him move on, headed for the docking hatch rather than the mess.[/i]"
TASK_14_CB_5,"[i]""One more thing,"" Ares says, turning toward you again. ""I don’t know if you’re feeling guilty for Kassal’s death, but I want to assure you, you did all you could.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CB_PLAYER_5A,"Thank you."
TASK_14_CB_PLAYER_5B,"How do you know?"
TASK_14_CB_6,"[i]""You’re good soldiers, but flawless victory is a fantasy at best. Kassal should have reported something. He should have asked for help.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CB_PLAYER_6A,"So it’s Burin’s fault he died?"
TASK_14_CB_PLAYER_6B,"Unlike him to go off half-cocked."
TASK_14_CB_7A,"[i]""Yes, frankly,"" Ares says flatly. ""The Alliance is full of operatives who are not soldiers. They have no military training, no discipline. It’s a liability, all too often.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CB_7B,"[i]""Kassal was self-sufficient before he joined the Alliance,"" Ares says. ""He may have been very cautious, but that doesn’t mean he fit into the machine. There are far too many people like that, people who lack discipline, in the Rebellion.""[/i]"
TASK_14_CB_PLAYER_7A,"Yes. These rogues are dangerous."
TASK_14_CB_PLAYER_7B,"No. Those people are great assets."
TASK_14_CB_8A,"[i]""You’re more observant than I expected. I am glad that you can be relied on."" Ares gives you a nod once again before moving on, his footsteps echoing on the deck.[/i]"
TASK_14_CB_8B,"[i]""Agree to disagree, then."" Ares gives you a nod once again before moving on, his footsteps echoing on the deck.[/i]"
TASK_15_NAME,"Distress Call"
TASK_15_DESC,"[i]You answer a distress call from the Rebel corvette [/i]Strider[i].[/i]\n\nAlly: Rebel Troopers"

TASK_15_1_1,"[i]Your ship drops out of hyperspace into a warzone. Rebel fighters dart across space, dogfighting with swarming TIE fighters. In the middle of the fray, the [/i]Strider[i], a rebel CR90 corvette, lists, its massive engines burning. The [/i]Strider[i]’s turrets spit fire as bold TIE pilots make attack runs to try to finish the ship off.[/i]"
TASK_15_1_2,"[i]An A-wing pulls alongside your ship, and the pilot’s voice comes through your comm. ""Green Leader to Rescue 3. The last shuttle got the command crew off the corvette. There are some troopers still trapped in there. We’ll cover you.""[/i]"
TASK_15_PLAYER_1,"Take us in."
TASK_15_2,"[i]Your ship moves alongside the [/i]Strider[i], and a heavy clank tells you the docking clamps are engaged. Time to go to work.\n\nYou run through the hatch into the interior of the corvette. The ship shudders as it starts to break apart. You have very little time.[/i]"
TASK_15_PLAYER_2A,"Check the gunnery compartment."
TASK_15_PLAYER_2B,"Check the infirmary."
TASK_15_3A,"[i]You dash toward the gunnery compartment and find several rebel troopers there, doing what they can to return fire against the attacking TIE fighters. You announce that it’s time to get out of here.\n\nOne trooper, straining against a door, protests. ""There are more crew trapped through here! Something’s blocking the door. We can’t leave them!"" You can see several troopers through the narrow opening between door and bulkhead, their bodies unmoving. You can’t be sure if there’s anyone left in there to save.[/i]"
TASK_15_PLAYER_3AA,"Use the ship's weapons to buy some time."
TASK_15_PLAYER_3AB,"Try to force the door."
TASK_15_PLAYER_3AC,"You don’t have time. Escape!"
TASK_15_3B,"[i]The infirmary’s been evacuated. It doesn’t look like the crew had time to gather up all of the ship’s medical supplies, but you’ll have less time to rescue survivors if you stay to search.[/i]"
TASK_15_PLAYER_3BA,"Search the infirmary."
TASK_15_PLAYER_3BB,"There’s no time! Keep searching for survivors."
TASK_15_INFIRMARY,"[i]You search the infirmary as quickly as you can.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_15_MEDPACK,"[i]You find some useful supplies.[/i]\n\nYou gained 1 medpac."
TASK_15_NO_MEDPACK,"[i]You don’t find anything useful.[/i]"
TASK_15_4A,"[i]You take the controls of the [/i]Strider[i]’s dorsal turrets. Targeting systems are completely inoperable; you’ll have to try to hit the TIEs unassisted. Downing even one TIE could buy you precious seconds.[/i]\n\nOne hero tests ."
TASK_15_4AA,"[i]You take careful aim along the TIEs’ flight path and open fire. The corvette’s powerful turbolasers thunder into the void. TIE fighters scatter, but a few are not fast enough on their controls; you vaporize two fighters, buying precious time.[/i]"
TASK_15_4AB,"[i]The corvette’s powerful turbolasers thunder into the void as you blindly spread fire in a broad arc. Judging by the continued shuddering of the [/i]Strider[i], you don’t think your counterattack accomplished much.[/i]"
TASK_15_4B,"[i]The blast door separating this compartment from the next is an emergency measure to contain fire and hard vacuum. This door did not fully close, its motors obstructed by some debris during the battle. The opening is not quite enough to fit a person through.[/i]"
TASK_15_DOOR_TEST,"[i]You strain to force the door open.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
TASK_15_DOOR_TEST_HIT,"[i]You strain to force the door open.[/i]\n\nAll heroes who did not test for the guns test  or . Each hero may reroll 1 die. Input the total ."
TASK_15_DOOR_TEST_MISS,"[i]You strain to force the door open.[/i]\n\nAll heroes who did not test for the guns test  or . Input the total ."
TASK_15_4C,"[i]You can’t risk the lives of your squad and the crew you’ve already rescued on the chance that someone in the sealed compartment is still alive. You hurry back to your ship.[/i]"
TASK_15_5A,"[i]With a concerted effort, you force the blast door open. Beyond, acrid flames lick at your senses. The cacophony rouses several troopers, burned and exhausted, but alive.\n\nYou don’t wait for them to regain their senses; you haul them to their feet and make for the ship as quickly as you can move. No sooner has the hatch closed behind you do the [/i]Strider[i]’s engines explode in a brilliant fireball.\n\nYou jump to hyperspace, leaving the battle behind.[/i]"
TASK_15_5B,"[i]You strain against the blast door, but it’s not moving.\n\nYou’re out of time. One of the troopers you rescued returns to pull you away from the blast door, and you sprint back to your ship. No sooner has the hatch closed behind you do the [/i]Strider[i]’s bulging engines explode in a brilliant fireball.\n\nYou jump to hyperspace, leaving the battle behind.[/i]"
TASK_15_5C,"[i]Your ship pulls away as the [/i]Strider[i] is ripped apart by a series of explosions. You’re well clear of the blast radius by the time the engine section goes up, taking most of the ship with it in a huge fireball.\n\nYou jump to hyperspace, leaving the battle behind.[/i]"
TASK_15_REWARD_1,"You receive regular Rebel Troopers as allies for the next mission!"
TASK_15_REWARD_2,"You receive regular Rebel Troopers as allies for the next 2 missions!"
TASK_16_NAME,"Shooting Stars"
TASK_16_DESC,"[i]Join Luke Skywalker and his X-wing squadron in a mission to capture Imperial supplies.[/i]\n\nAlly: Luke Skywalker (Hero of the Rebellion)"

TASK_16_1,"[i]You’ve been designated ""Shooting Star 1"" for this mission. You drop out of hyperspace in formation with a group of X-wings and several other light freighters like your own. Half a dozen Imperial [/i]Gozanti[i]-class cruisers thrust between nav points along a minor Imperial supply line, with this stretch of space being its most vulnerable point. While many of the Imperial cargo haulers carry bulky, external cargo containers, others carry docked TIEs—TIEs that waste no time in decoupling from their parent ships and moving to engage.[/i]"
TASK_16_2,"[i]""Red 9, you’re with me!"" the lead X-wing pilot orders. You met the leader briefly before the mission: Luke Skywalker. He’s one of the youngest fighter pilots you’ve met in the Rebellion. ""Form up, and take your targets."" Luke and his wingmate move to flank your ship as you vector toward the Imperial freighter at the front of the line.[/i]"
TASK_16_3,"[i]A formation of TIE fighters scream toward you. You ready your ship’s turrets to return fire.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
TASK_16_3_SUCCESS,"[i]Your turrets spit volatile blasts into space. One of the braver TIE pilots pays for his ambition as your laser fire burns through the strut attaching one of the TIE’s wings to its ball cockpit; the rest of the craft goes spinning into space.[/i]"
TASK_16_3_FAILURE,"[i]Your turrets spit volatile blasts into space. The TIEs swerve and zigzag, fouling your aim. Your ship rocks as your shields absorb several laser hits as the TIEs pass.[/i]"
TASK_16_4,"[i]The Imperial freighter’s heavy lasers clash against your shields. They’re holding for now, but you can’t take too many hits like that.\n\n""Torpedoes!"" Luke calls. You see several proton torpedoes impact the Imperial freighter’s aft section. The glow from its engines fades, and it starts to drift. ""Get that cargo, Shooting Star 1. We’ll cover you.""[/i]"
TASK_16_5,"[i]You bring your ship beneath the Imperial freighter. A few carefully placed shots destroy the docking clamps holding the external cargo container to the underside of the cruiser. You line up your own docking clamps to pick up the cargo as more TIEs come around to attack again.[/i]"
TASK_16_PLAYER_5A,"Take evasive maneuvers."
TASK_16_PLAYER_5B,"Let your escorts handle it."
TASK_16_PLAYER_5C,"Go on the offensive."
TASK_16_6A,"[i]You pull away from the drifting container and throw your freighter into a wild corkscrew. Even moving erratically, your ship is a large target and hard to miss, but a moving target is much harder to hit than a stationary one.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_16_6B,"[i]You continue to execute docking procedures with the container. The TIEs score a few hits on your shields before the X-wings take them down.[/i]"
TASK_16_6C,"[i]You pull away from the drifting container and bring your turrets to bear.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
TASK_16_6A_SUCCESS,"[i]The TIEs try to pin you down, and a few hits glance off your shields. You keep up your erratic path until your escorts have destroyed or driven off the TIEs.[/i]"
TASK_16_6A_FAILURE,"[i]The TIEs try to pin you down, and your ship rocks as you take several solid hits before your escorts destroy or drive off the TIEs.[/i]"
TASK_16_6C_SUCCESS,"[i]You exchange fire with the TIEs. Lasers flash against your shields, but your own vaporize one TIE and badly damage another.[/i]"
TASK_16_6C_FAILURE,"[i]You exchange fire with the TIEs. Lasers flash against your shields, your ship shuddering from several solid impacts. Your return fire clips the wing of one TIE, and it veers off as it breaks apart.[/i]"
TASK_16_7,"[i]You dock with the container and hear the satisfying [/i]thunk[i] of the docking clamps engaging. The extra mass makes your controls sluggish.\n\n""The TIEs are coming back around,"" Luke warns you. Through your viewport, you see some TIEs head for you, while others zero in on your escort, Red 9.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
TASK_16_7_SUCCESS,"[i]You line up shots on the remaining TIEs; they don’t see you coming, letting you easily fire along their flank, your lasers tearing through the solar panels of their wings. ""Thanks for the assist, Shooting Star 1!"" Red 9 calls as she tilts her X-wing side to side in thanks.[/i]"
TASK_16_7_FAILURE,"[i]You get a bead on a few TIEs, but there are more than you can take down. The TIEs score several hits on Red 9’s engines. They explode, and the rest of the fighter tumbles end over end. The fuselage is intact, but the ship isn’t going anywhere.[/i]"
TASK_16_7_FAILURE_2,"[i]""Red 9! What’s your status?"" Red 9 doesn’t respond to Luke’s queries. You’re deep enough in Imperial space that there’s little chance she’ll be recovered if you don’t do it, but you can’t attach to Red 9’s fighter and your stolen cargo at the same time.[/i]"
TASK_16_PLAYER_7A,"Detach your cargo, and pick up Red 9."
TASK_16_PLAYER_7B,"Complete your mission."
TASK_16_8A,"[i]You disconnect the docking clamps and let the Imperial container free as you move in on the wreckage of Red 9’s X-wing. Your docking clamp grips the remains of the X-wing’s fuselage. With Red 9 safely in tow, you jump to hyperspace with the rest of Red Squadron.[/i]"
TASK_16_8B,"[i]The supplies you’ve captured are important to the Rebellion. You’ve got to follow your orders. You jump to hyperspace alongside the rest of Red Squadron, heading back to the fleet with your captured cargo.[/i]"
TASK_16_NO_TIES,"[i]""No more TIEs on our scopes,"" Luke signals. ""Get your cargo and jump out of here."" With no more hostiles incoming, you jump to hyperspace alongside the rest of Red Squadron with your captured cargo.[/i]"
TASK_16_SHIELDS_FAIL,"[i]Your shields fail. Any more hits like that and you’ll need to retreat.[/i]"
TASK_16_DAMAGE,"[i]You feel the laser impacts send tremors through your freighter. Emergency lights start flashing in the cockpit. Your docking clamps fail, meaning you won’t be able to haul home the cargo you came for.\n\n""Get out of here, Shooting Star 1!"" Luke shouts. ""You’ve done all you can."" While he covers you, you calculate a quick jump to hyperspace and safety.[/i]"
TASK_16_END_1,"[i]After returning to the fleet, Luke approaches you. He pulls off his helmet, revealing a very young face and sandy hair. ""Good work out there,"" he says.[/i]"
TASK_16_END_TIES,"[i]""That was some impressive shooting, taking out so many TIEs."" He nods. ""Several of our X-wings are grounded for repairs, but I heard you have some other missions lined up. I’d be glad to help if you need it.""[/i]"
TASK_16_END_RED9,"[i]""I know you might catch some flak for rescuing Red 9, but you saved her life. If you ask me, that’s more important than some spare ship parts."" He nods. ""Several of our X-wings are grounded for repairs, but I heard you have some other missions lined up. I’d be glad to help if you need it.""[/i]"
TASK_16_END_CARGO,"[i]""Those spare parts are going to keep a lot of our starfighters flying. We need every ship we can get."" He nods. ""Several of our X-wings are grounded for repairs, but I heard you have some other missions lined up. I’d be glad to help if you need it.""[/i]"
TASK_16_END_DAMAGE,"[i]""I’m sorry we couldn’t keep you covered better. That was some good flying anyway."" He nods. ""Several of our X-wings are grounded for repairs, but I heard you have some other missions lined up. I’d be glad to help if you need it.""[/i]"

TASK_17_1,"[i]Han Solo brings the [/i]Millennium Falcon[i] in to land at a remote spaceport on Devaron. The smuggler powers down his ship’s engines. ""I’d give us an hour before the Empire figures out our transport codes were sliced,"" Han says. ""Chewie and I will make sure we’ve got a way out of the system. You pick up our cargo.""[/i]"

TASK_17_PLAYER_2,"Thanks for the warning."
TASK_17_3,"[i]Intelligence gave you only paltry information on your ""cargo:"" a Devaronian politician who wants to escape the Empire’s grip on the planet and join the Rebel Alliance.\n\nYou head away from the docking bay along toward a clutch of buildings that pass for the spaceport proper.

TASK_17_PLAYER_3A,"Act casual."
TASK_17_PLAYER_3B,"Avoid them."
TASK_17_4A,"[i]""Stop there."" A stormtrooper holds out a gloved hand toward you as you approach. ""Let me see your identifications."" Several other stormtroopers sidle over, blaster rifles relaxed but at the ready.[/i]"
TASK_17_PLAYER_4AA,"Of course. Is there something wrong?"
TASK_17_PLAYER_4AB,"You don’t need to see our identifications."
TASK_17_5A,"[i]You hand over your identifications—forged by Rebel Intelligence, of course. The stormtrooper glances at them, then passes them to another to run through a scanner.\n\nThe first stormtrooper points to a shimmering display along the side of their security hovel. A row of Devaronian holos stares back at you. ""Reports of dangerous rebels in the area."" They pass you back your identifications; everything checks out. ""If you see any of these individuals, you are required to report it.""[/i]"
TASK_17_5B,"[i]You see several troopers tense up. ""I won’t ask again,"" says the first trooper. He doesn’t have much of a sense of humor, apparently.\n\nYou hand over your identifications—forged by Rebel Intelligence, of course. Several moments pass in uncomfortable silence as one of the troopers runs each one through a scanner. Finally, they hand them back to you; everything checks out. ""Stay out of trouble,"" the first trooper says.[/i]"
TASK_17_PLAYER_5A,"We’ll keep our eyes open."
TASK_17_PLAYER_5B,"We will."
TASK_17_4B,"[i]You try to avoid the stormtroopers.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_17_4B_SUCCESS,"[i]You slow your pace enough to give you time to observe the stormtroopers’ patrol routes. As a bulky landspeeder approaches the spaceport, you jog alongside, keeping the speeder’s cargo bed between you and the stormtroopers the whole way. You don’t think you were spotted.[/i]"
TASK_17_6,"[i]You reach the rendezvous point and slip into the dingy restaurant you find there. Three Devaronians wait inside, two men and an older woman, the latter’s face lined with experience.[/i]"
TASK_17_PLAYER_6,"We’re your ride."
TASK_17_RECOGNITION,"[i]You’re some of the only off-worlders walking the streets of the spaceport, other than a small stormtrooper patrol at each corner.\n\nYou reach the rendezvous point and slip into the dingy restaurant you find there. Three Devaronians wait inside, two men and an older woman, the latter’s face lined with experience.\n\nYou realize that the three Devaronians all match faces you saw on the wanted boards at the stormtrooper checkpoint.[/i]"
TASK_17_9A,"[i]You hurry back the way you came with the Devaronians in tow. Taking it carefully, and sticking to the shadows, you are able to make it back to the [/i]Millennium Falcon[i].\n\nJust after you arrive, stormtroopers burst into the bay and open fire. You have only a moment to get to some cover and return fire. Above, a particle shield powers on, trapping the [/i]Falcon[i] in the bay.[/i]"
TASK_17_9A_ALERT,"[i]You hurry back the way you came with the Devaronians in tow. Taking it carefully, and sticking to the shadows, you are able to make it back to the [/i]Millennium Falcon[i].\n\nJust after you arrive, stormtroopers burst into the bay and open fire. You have only a moment to get to some cover and return fire.

TASK_17_PLAYER_9AA,"Shoot out the shield generator."
TASK_17_PLAYER_9AB,"Find the shield controls."
TASK_17_11B,"[i]You escort the Devaronians into the bay. Han waves them up the ramp just as a particle shield powers on, covering the bay’s exit and trapping the [/i]Falcon[i] inside. ""We need to take care of that shield before more stormtroopers show up,"" Han shouts over the sound of the [/i]Falcon[i]’s engines starting.[/i]"
TASK_17_10AA,"[i]More stormtroopers enter the bay, undeterred by you or Han. You scan the top of the bay and spot the particle shield’s generator. Venturing out from beneath the safety of the [/i]Falcon[i], you brave the blaster fire to line up a shot.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
TASK_17_10AA_SUCCESS,"[i]You take careful aim at the most vulnerable part of the shield generator. Your first several shots ricochet off the shield generator’s protective casing, but one finds its target. The generator flashes as its internals explode, and the shield flickers and dies.\n\nYou run up the [/i]Falcon[i]’s ramp with Han as he yells. ""Chewie, get us out of here!""[/i]"
TASK_17_10AA_FAILURE,"[i]The stormtroopers keep you from being able to line up a good shot. Your shots ricochet harmlessly off the generator’s protective casing. Han levels his blaster pistol at the generator and fires. The generator flashes as its internals explode, and the shield flickers and dies.\n\nYou run up the [/i]Falcon[i]’s ramp with Han as he yells. ""Chewie, get us out of here!""[/i]"
TASK_17_10AB,"[i]More stormtroopers enter the bay, undeterred by you or Han. You look for a control panel and spot one across the bay. Venturing out from beneath the safety of the [/i]Falcon[i], you brave the blaster fire to reach the panel.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
TASK_17_10AB_SUCCESS,"[i]The console does not directly control the shield, but it does seem to control the bay’s power. If you cut power to the shield you might be able to escape. You throw several breakers and, when that doesn’t seem to do the trick, yank a corroded power converter out of its socket. The shield flickers and dies.\n\nYou run up the [/i]Falcon[i]’s ramp with Han as he yells. ""Chewie, get us out of here!""[/i]"
TASK_17_10AB_FAILURE,"[i]You make your way to the console, but blaster fire keeps you from being able to do what you need. Han levels his blaster pistol at the shield’s generator and fires.

TASK_17_END_1,"[i]While you were retrieving the Devaronians, Han managed to get details on the patrol routes of Imperial cruisers in the system. With the trap in the docking bay behind you, Han takes the [/i]Falcon[i] safely to hyperspace.[/i]"
TASK_17_END_2,"[i]Once you are safely away, Han finds you in the [/i]Falcon[i]’s common area. ""Thanks for sticking your neck out back there,"" he says with some effort. ""If you need a hand with anything, I owe you a favor.""[/i]"

TASK_18_2,"[i]You wait aboard the [/i]Millennium Falcon[i] while Han Solo deals with a local informant outside the ship. When Solo comes back aboard, his Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, gives an irritable growl. ""I told you, Drem won’t deal with us if you come along. We’re lucky he’s talking to us at all after that stunt you pulled last time.""\n\nThe smuggler swivels toward you. ""You should probably stay here, too. Drem gets anxious around unfamiliar faces, and we’re already asking him to 'lose' a bunch of hyperdrive modules.""[/i]"
TASK_18_PLAYER_2,"Stay here? Then why did we even come?"
TASK_18_3,"[i]""Someone at Command wants to keep an eye on me, I guess. But I work better on my own."" Chewbacca voices what you think is disagreement.\n\nSolo leaves you alone on the [/i]Falcon[i] with Chewbacca. The Wookiee is sulking elbow deep in one of the ship’s maintenance crawlspaces.[/i]"
TASK_18_3_WOOKIEE,"[i]""Someone at Command wants to keep an eye on me, I guess. But I work better on my own."" Chewbacca disagrees, but Solo doesn’t pay attention to him. He flashes a roguish smile.

TASK_18_TALK_CHEWIE_4,"Can I interest you in a game of dejarik?"
TASK_18_CHEWIE_RESPONSE_1,"[i]Chewbacca pokes his head up from his work just long enough to give a short growl, but you aren’t sure what that conveys. It would be very useful to know Shyriiwook, apparently.[/i]"
TASK_18_CHEWIE_RESPONSE_WOOKIEE,"[i]Chewbacca pokes his head up from his work just long enough to tell you that he doesn’t like being left behind, especially since Solo has a way of finding trouble.[/i]"
TASK_18_CHEWIE_RESPONSE_2,"[i]Chewbacca makes a series of truncated warbles. You get the feeling he’s brushing off your inquiries.[/i]"
TASK_18_CHEWIE_RESPONSE_3,"[i]Chewbacca doesn’t dignify that with an answer. He probably didn’t hear you. Probably.[/i]"
TASK_18_4,"[i]Chewbacca perks up at the mention of the game. You have a brief moment to think you may have made a connection before the grinding of metal on metal fills the room.\n\nYou follow Chewbacca down the [/i]Falcon[i]’s ramp. Buzz droids swarm over the ship, saw blades whirring and fusion cutters firecracker bright. Chewbacca blasts one, and several droids break off and leap toward you and the Wookiee.[/i]"
TASK_18_4_WOOKIEE,"[i]You chat with Chewbacca for a while, and he shares the story of how they fell in with the Alliance. You’re just setting up for a game of dejarik when the grinding of metal on metal fills the room.\n\n[/i]You follow Chewbacca down the [/i]Falcon[i]’s ramp.

TASK_18_5A_FAIL,"[i]The droids are on you in moments, clinging and stabbing and swiping with buzzsaws sharp enough to carve through a starfighter’s hull. For each droid you manage to disable, more come at you, and it’s impossible to avoid some injury.[/i]\n\nChoose 1 hero to be injured. This hero may not test or use abilities for the rest of this encounter."
TASK_18_5B_SUCCEED,"[i]You take out a few of the closest droids, but it’s clear that trying to take them down one by one is an uphill battle. The droids act in precise concert, more like a single entity than a swarm of smaller ones. That’s much cleverer than buzz droids usually are. Someone is giving them commands.[/i]"
TASK_18_5B_FAIL,"[i]You take out a few of the closest droids, but it’s clear that trying to take them down one by one is an uphill battle.

This hero may not test or use abilities for the rest of this encounter."
TASK_18_5C_SUCCEED,"[i]You spot an old, ill-maintained power generator, intended for recharging a ship’s power cells. Now, it looks more like a safety hazard. Fighting off a few buzz droids, you make your way to it.\n\nYou bypass the generator’s safety interlocks and aim a rusted power conduit at the thickest part of the buzz droid swarm. Lightning arcs from the end of the conduit, cracking across one buzz droid, to another, to another. The droids quiver, their arachnoid limbs dancing, and one by one go limp.[/i]"

Everything is so corroded that it’s a challenge just getting the unit to start, and you get a nasty shock for your efforts.[/i]\n\nChoose 1 hero to be stunned by the generator. This hero may not test or use abilities for the rest of this encounter."
TASK_18_6A,"[i]Chewbacca bats a droid off of himself and aims his bowcaster upward, tracing his line of sight over the [/i]Falcon[i]. He fires, and you follow the shot to see it just miss a retreating figure in an armored cloak on a high maintenance catwalk. Chewbacca growls and points.[/i]"
TASK_18_6B,"[i]You scan the docking bay, looking for a sign of other assailants, and spot a figure in an armored cloak crouched on a high maintenance catwalk. You point the figure out to Chewbacca just as the figure realizes he’s been seen and starts to run.[/i]"
TASK_18_6C,"[i]A blaster bolt strikes the generator just as you adjust your aim at another group of buzz droids. The generator whines and dies, useless. You look up toward the blaster bolt’s origin and see a figure in an armored cloak running along a high maintenance catwalk.[/i]"

TASK_18_8_SUCCEED,"[i]You power through, circling part of the [/i]Falcon[i]’s berth before swerving into a utility corridor running alongside the spaceport’s bays. You can see the attacker in the distance, and you’re closing in. You are mere meters apart when he spins and lobs a shock grenade at you.[/i]"
TASK_18_PLAYER_8A,"Go faster."
TASK_18_PLAYER_8B,"Knock it away."
TASK_18_8_FAIL,"[i]You run as fast as you are able, but the attacker has a significant head start. You circle part of the [/i]Falcon[i]’s berth before swerving into a utility corridor running alongside the spaceport’s bays. You slam headlong into a gonk droid as you round the corner. The droid topples, blocking your way. Ahead, you can just make out the silhouette of the attacker disappearing out into the city.\n\n""Gonk,"" grumbles the droid.[/i]"
TASK_18_9A_SUCCEED,"[i]You dig deep, finding new reserves of strength to drive forward. The grenade bounces past you, and you hear the sharp snap of its detonation somewhere in your past.\n\nYou tackle the attacker, knocking him to the ground. He rolls onto his back to aim his blaster at you, but you’ve got weapons pointed at him first. He drops his own and holds up his hands just as Chewbacca catches up to you. ""I give! I give!""[/i]"
TASK_18_9B_SUCCEED,"[i]You watch the grenade’s arc and, at just the right moment, knock it from the sky with your weapon. The grenade soars back the way it came, rewinding its trajectory, until you hear the sharp snap of its detonation. The attacker is caught in the blast; he suddenly goes as slack as a snapped cable and falls to the ground.\n\nYou close the remaining distance and point weapons at him as he starts to regain muscle control. He holds up his hands just as Chewbacca catches up to you. ""I give! I give!""[/i]"
TASK_18_9_FAIL,"[i]You can only dive for cover before the grenade goes off. The crackling detonation makes your hair stand on end, but otherwise you are unscathed.\n\nYou leap back to your feet, but the attacker is far down the corridor. Catching him doesn’t seem likely, at least, not until a wall of fur rockets out of an adjoining corridor and slams him against a wall.\n\nChewbacca lifts the dazed attacker by his shoulders, teeth bared, growling. The attacker struggles to hold up his hands in surrender. ""I give! I give!""[/i]"
TASK_18_PLAYER_9,"Who are you?"
TASK_18_10,"[i]""Bounty hunter. Your friend Captain Solo owes Jabba the Hutt some money."" Chewbacca grips the bounty hunter and shakes him, snarling all the while. ""I got it! I got it! I don’t plan to collect. Too dangerous for what Jabba’s paying.""\n\nChewbacca takes the jury-rigged droid caller the bounty hunter had been using to control the buzz droids. The Wookiee makes eye contact with the bounty hunter, then smashes the caller against a wall. The bounty hunter nods quickly, getting the message. When Chewbacca lets him go, he runs faster than when you were chasing him.[/i]"
TASK_18_11,"[i]You return to the [/i]Falcon[i]. Your quick reaction saved the [/i]Falcon[i] from even superficial damage, and you just have a few cuts and scrapes.\n\nIt’s another hour before Solo returns. He slows his swagger as he passes by the pile of wrecked droids. ""You just couldn’t keep yourself out of trouble, could you?"" he says to Chewbacca.[/i]"
TASK_18_PLAYER_11,"Did you make your deal?"
TASK_18_12,"[i]Solo’s attention is directed at the [/i]Falcon[i], and he answers you as if unenthusiastically reading from a script. ""One of Drem’s freighters is going to make a navigational error in a few days. Everything’s set."" Apparently satisfied that his ship is still in one piece, Solo relaxes his shoulders and tosses another glance at Chewbacca. ""And you said there was going to be trouble.""\n\nAs Solo disappears up the [/i]Falcon[i]’s ramp, Chewbacca nods at you in approval. He’s clearly impressed. You’ve never impressed a Wookiee before.[/i]"

Wrecker-1 peers around the edge of a crate. ""Troop transport incoming,"" he says, pointing out a boxy speeder coming to a stop. ""We’ve got a few spare charges.""[/i]"
TASK_19_PLAYER_2A,"Let’s rig some vehicles to blow."
TASK_19_PLAYER_2B,"Too risky. We’re just here for that antenna."
TASK_19_3A,"[i]Wrecker-1 motions to Wrecker-3. ""Set up that transport to blow."" Wrecker-3 nods and slips out of hiding to make his way toward the transport.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_19_3A_SUCCESS,"[i]You spot the transport’s driver walking toward it just as Wrecker-3 gets to work. You sneak close and subdue the driver quietly before he can reveal your presence.[/i]"
TASK_19_3A_FAILURE,"[i]""Who are you?"" You turn to see the transport’s driver drawing a blaster and pointing it toward Wrecker-3. The Duros brings his carbine up, but the driver is quicker on the trigger; several shots drop Wrecker-3.\n\nKlaxons blare. Wrecker-1 shoots the driver before he can do any more damage. ""They’re on high alert. It will be harder to get in, especially in a group like this."" He looks to you. ""We’re trained for this sort of situation. I suggest you get to the rendezvous point. We’ll meet you there.""[/i]"
TASK_19_PLAYER_3AFA,"Not going to happen."
TASK_19_PLAYER_3AFB,"Okay. Good luck."
TASK_19_3B,"[i]You are able to skirt the edge of the outpost by going from container to container. Slowly, you work your way inward.\n\nWrecker-1 adjusts the magnification on his goggles. ""Those canisters there are compressed tibanna gas. Makes a good explosion with little provocation. We still have some spare charges.""[/i]"
TASK_19_PLAYER_3BA,"Set the charges."
TASK_19_PLAYER_3BB,"It won’t blow that antenna. Save your charges."
TASK_19_4AF,"[i]An AT-DP rears its head and fires its laser cannons at your cover, forcing you to hunker down even lower.\n\n""Grenades!"" Wrecker-1 shouts. Two of his team arm anti-vehicle explosives and lob them at the AT-DP. One explodes just near the walker’s pod, rocking it on its legs and fouling its shots.[/i]"
TASK_19_4BA,"[i]Wrecker-1 motions to Wrecker-4. ""Rig those tibanna canisters. That’ll give the Empire a shock."" Wrecker-4 moves to do as ordered.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_19_4BA_SUCCESS,"[i]You notice a pair of stormtroopers making the rounds. You signal Wrecker-4 that he needs to hide. He moves behind the tibanna canisters and waits for the stormtroopers to pass.[/i]"
TASK_19_4BA_FAILURE,"[i]""You there! Stop!"" A pair of stormtroopers runs toward Wrecker-4. Wrecker-4 draws his blaster and shoots the first stormtrooper, but the second hits Wrecker-4 in the chest. As the Duros sags to the ground, his hand opens, and a concussion grenade rolls free.\n\n""Down!"" Wrecker-1 bellows, just before the grenade goes off, taking the tibanna gas canisters with it.[/i]"
TASK_19_4BB,"[i]You move quickly to the shadow of the control bunker. The antenna above blots out the sun. A security panel controls the blast door between you and your target. You don't have the access codes, so you'll have to bypass the panel's security.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
TASK_19_4BB_SUCCESS,"[i]You set to work bypassing the Imperial security protocols. They’re good, but you’ve broken through worse. The door opens.\n\n""Alright. We’re going to set the charges on the generator,"" Wrecker-1 says. ""Keep an eye out.""[/i]"
TASK_19_4BB_FAILURE,"[i]The Imperials have some heavy-duty security on this door, and despite your best efforts, you can’t seem to bypass it.\n\n""We’ll have to do this the noisy way,"" Wrecker-1 says. He and Wrecker-2 start placing charges on the door. ""Hit the control room and stop them from coordinating. That will buy us the time we need to blow the generator.""[/i]"
TASK_19_5BBS,"[i]You slip inside, away from prying eyes. While the Wreckers head toward the generator, you creep toward the outpost’s control room. As you approach, you hear the voice of an Imperial officer.\n\n""Sir, there’s a discrepancy in our security logs. Unauthorized access,"" the young officer reports.\n\nAnother officer replies, ""Is it a malfunction?""\n\n""I can’t say, sir,"" the young officer answers. ""I’ll scan the security feeds just to be sure."" He moves to monitor the bunker’s cameras.[/i]"
TASK_19_5BBF,"[i]With the charges set, the Wreckers rejoin you in cover. Wrecker-1 pulls out a detonator. He counts silently before hitting the button on the detonator. The door blows inward, gaping wounds allowing you access.\n\nWhile the Wreckers head toward the generator, you run toward the outpost’s control room. You hear frantic voices trying to figure out what just happened and coordinate a response.[/i]"
TASK_19_CHAOS,"[i]The distant explosions draw the attention of the Imperial officers. The commanding officer starts barking orders. ""Find whoever is doing that! Send reinforcements toward those coordinates!"" You can tell their control over the situation is slipping.[/i]"
TASK_19_ATTACK,"Attack."
TASK_19_DISTRACT,"Set off charges to create a distraction."
TASK_19_BLOW_WHAT,"[i]If you order the Wreckers to set off some of the charges they placed earlier, you could sow chaos amongst the Imperial forces.[/i]"
TASK_19_5AF,"[i]Your ears are ringing as you recover. You see the AT-DP wavering on its spindly legs, crowned by flame, before it topples. Wrecker-1 and his team are fitting large charges to the troop transport. ""Get clear! We’ll meet you at the rendezvous!"" Wrecker-1 shouts.\n\nAs you fall back, heading for the forest, you see Wrecker-1 start driving the transport toward the bunker.[/i]"
TASK_19_5BF,"[i]You blink. Your whole squad is on their backs. A plume of fire and smoke rises above you. Your ears are ringing. How long were you out?\n\nYou signal Wrecker-1. His voice comes through, though it’s hard to pick out from the background noise. ""We’re finishing the mission. Get to the rendezvous point.""[/i]"
TASK_19_6A,"[i]You charge into the room. The small group of Imperial technicians don’t stand a chance against your battle-tested skills.\n\nOut the transparisteel window in front of you, you see flashing red lights all across the outpost, and stormtroopers converging on your position. You signal Wrecker-1 that you haven’t got much time.\n\n""Get out of here. We’re not done yet. We’ll catch up with you at the rendezvous point.""[/i]"
TASK_19_PLAYER_STAY,"We aren’t leaving without you."
TASK_19_PLAYER_GO,"Acknowledged. See you at the rendezvous."
TASK_19_7A,"[i]""I appreciate the sentiment, but your sacrifice will gain the Alliance nothing,"" Wrecker-1 says. ""We’re trained for this.""\n\nStormtroopers start to pour into the control bunker. You set up a defensive position to pick them off, but you can only hold out for so long.[/i]"
TASK_19_8A,"[i]More stormtroopers arrive. Blaster bolts sear the air close enough for you to feel their heat. Every stormtrooper you take out is replaced with two more.\n\n""Charges are set!"" Wrecker-1 shouts from your comlink. ""Get going! We’ll be right behind you!""[/i]"
TASK_19_7B,"[i]You get out of the listening post as quickly as you can. Stormtroopers catch you as you exit, but you’ve been in worse spots. You dispatch a few and force the others to keep their heads down long enough for you to escape, and you are able to keep from fighting any battles too large for you to win.[/i]"
TASK_19_END_1,"[i]As you reach the edge of the listening post, you hear a detonation. You turn to see a red-orange blossom erupt from the side of the control bunker. Another detonation breaks the din, and then another; the flames consume the bunker with monstrous appetite.[/i]"
TASK_19_END_2,"[i]Later, at your rendezvous point, you see {0} Duros emerge from the trees. They’re singed and a little rattled, but intact. A quick count shows that you’re missing a few, Wrecker-1 included. Wrecker-2, now the ranking member of the team, shakes his head. ""It was a bad situation,"" he says. ""But you still have our support.""[/i]"
TASK_19_BLOW_VEHICLES,"Blow those vehicles, Wrecker-3."
TASK_19_VEHICLES_EXPLODE,"[i]An explosion lifts the troop transport off the ground. Imperials scramble, looking for possible attack from the air or vehicular weaponry.[/i]"
TASK_19_BLOW_TIBANNA,"Blow that tibanna, Wrecker-4."
TASK_19_TIBANNA_EXPLODE,"[i]In a series of rapid-fire booms, the tibanna gas canisters blow, creating a towering plume of flame and knocking nearly everyone outside the bunker off their feet.[/i]"
TASK_19_HOLD,"Hold the line."
TASK_19_REWARD_1,"You receive regular Rebel Saboteurs as allies for the next mission!"
TASK_19_REWARD_2,"You receive regular Rebel Saboteurs as allies for the next 2 missions!"
ENCOUNTER_20_NAME,"In Trouble Again"
ENCOUNTER_20_DESC,"[i]Two Rebel agents have failed to check in during a mission to Toydaria. Find them and, if need be, render assistance.[/i]\n\nAlly: C-3P0 or R2-D2"
ENCOUNTER_20_1,"[i]Broad viewports look out of the Toydarian shadowport over the swamp, allowing pale daylight to filter in. It isn't long before you spot a portly Toydarian trying aggressively to sell a passersby a pair of droids matching the description of the missing Rebel agents, C-3PO and R2-D2.\n\nSeeing you approach, the Toydarian junk dealer does not miss a beat. ""I see you have a keen eye for fine droids! My name is Brogo. See anything you like?"" Brogo waves in the direction of a market stall populated mostly by knick-knacks and droids too old to be easily identified.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_1A,"Ask about the droids."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_1B,"Distract Brogo"
ENCOUNTER_20_DROIDS,"[i]""These two?"" He scowls in the pair's general direction. ""I'm sure I could find you something...better.""\n\n""I beg your pardon?"" protests C-3PO. ""I am very capable. In fact, I have been trusted with..."" R2-D2 whistles shrilly, cutting C-3PO off. ""In any case, we are not for sale.""\n\n""They are for sale,"" Brogo grumbles.\n\n""We are not,"" C-3PO insists.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_SALE,"Offer to buy the droids."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_NOSALE,"Coerce Brogo into freeing the droids."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_THEFT,"On second thought, steal the droids."
ENCOUNTER_20_NEGOTIATING,"[i]Alliance Command gave you a limited amount of credits to facilitate this rescue mission, and you hope what you have left will be enough to buy the droids outright. You make Brogo an offer. ""For both of them!? That's robbery!"" He glares at the droids. ""I'll give you one for that. Take your pick."" C-3PO looks at you hopefully, while R2-D2 lets out a mournful tone.[i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_ARTOO,"We'll take the blue one."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_THREEPIO,"We'll take the gold one."
ENCOUNTER_20_BOUGHT_ARTOO,"[i]Brogo detaches the restraining bolt from R2-D2. The astromech whistles, happy to be free of the restraining bolt. ""Artoo, don't leave me!"" calls C-3PO as you walk away. Somehow, you can see the sense of betrayal in his visual receptors.\n\nOnce you are out of earshot of Brogo, you tell R2-D2 that you are with the Alliance. The droid swivels his dome impassively for a moment before veering off down an adjoining corridor.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_WHERE?,"Where are you going?"
ENCOUNTER_20_ARTOO_HERO,"[i]R2-D2 wheels down the corridor fast enough that the beings in his way move aside before he slams into them. You follow along, trying to keep up with where the droid is headed. After an abrupt turn, the astromech extends his scomp link and plugs in to an access port.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_PREPARE,"Get ready to back up R2-D2."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_CALM,"Remain inconspicuous."
ENCOUNTER_20_READY,"[i]You move close to R2-D2, hands near your weapons.\n\nThe lights flicker, and the shutters on the broad viewports rattle down into place as the overhead lights die. The market corridors are plunged into darkness. You hear shouts, pirates and ne'er-do-wells drawing weapons. Yours are already in your hands, and when the blaster bolts start flying, you deftly return fire.\n\nR2-D2 bumps against you on his way back toward Brogo's stall.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_MOVE!,"Follow R2-D2."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_COVERFIRE,"Take down any threats."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_DISTRACTION,"Create a distraction."

ENCOUNTER_20_FIGHT_BACK_SUCCESS,"[i]You train your blasters on those who get too close to you and R2-D2 and put a few stun blasts into them to keep your charge safe. The chaos subsides as you bring down the more belligerent market-goers, and the others realize that they aren't under attack.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_FIGHT_BACK_FAILURE,"[i]You train your blasters on those who get too close to you and R2-D2 and put a few stun blasts into them, but discharging your weapons only seems to draw more fire. Though your armor absorbs the worst of the attacks coming your way, a few blaster bolts ping off R2-D2's chassis.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_DISTRACTION_JARROD,"[i]In the dark, Brogo swings his scattergun your way. ""I found these droids, fair and square!""\n\nJarrod dodges toward Brogo's other junked droids, rips open their maintenance panels and splices wires until the droids power up. He sends them lumbering mindlessly toward Brogo, forming a wall of metal. ""What are you doing? Get away, you buckets of bolts!""\n\nJax slices the restraining bolt from C-3PO, and you have ample time to leave with the droids before anyone else intervenes.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_DISTRACTION_NOJARROD,"[i]You overturn a nearby fruit stand, sending dozens of pungent melon-like fruits rolling down the corridor. You hear surprised shouts and see trails of blaster fire arc toward the ceiling as the combatants stumble on the fruit.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_NOT_READY,"[i]The lights flicker, and the shutters on the broad viewports rattle down into place as the overhead lights die. The market corridors are plunged into darkness. You hear shouts and weapons sliding from holsters.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_20_COMBAT_SUCCESS,"[i]You cover R2-D2, guided by the dim lights on his dome, as he trundles back toward Brogo's stall. Even in the darkness, you bring down any threats to the little droid.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_COMBAT_FAILURE,"[i]You try to cover R2-D2, guided by the dim lights on his dome, as he trundles back toward Brogo's stall, but between keeping your own heads down and trying to trace the source of the attacks in the darkness, a few blaster bolts ping off the astromech's plating.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_STEALTH,"[i]You slip toward the edge of the market, hoping to blend in.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_20_STEALTH_SUCCESS,"[i]The lights flicker, and the shutters on the broad viewports rattle down into place as the overhead lights die. The market corridors are plunged into darkness. You hear shouts as pirates and ne'er-do-wells draw weapons. You stay at the edge of the chaos until you spot the dim lights on R2-D2's dome heading back toward Brogo's stall.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_BOUGHT_THREEPIO,"[i]Brogo detaches the restraining bolt from C-3PO. The Toydarian seems relieved to be free of the protocol droid.\n\n""I commend you on your excellent taste,"" C-3PO says as you walk away, ""but I already have a master. I must return to her."" You tell C-3PO the Alliance sent you to rescue him and R2-D2. ""Oh. Oh, I see."" He peers back toward Brogo's stall. ""Then we must retrieve Artoo as well.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_WHAT?,"What do you know about Brogo?"
ENCOUNTER_20_THREEPIO_INTEL,"[i]""The other merchants at least tolerate him. I can't imagine why; he seems rather unpleasant."" C-3PO tilts his upper body, which you take to be the rough equivalent of cocking his head. ""I overheard him mention he is expecting a criminal operator of some repute. A Rodian, as I recall. He apparently owes this Rodian quite a lot of credits.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_THREEPIO_VINTO,"[i]""The other merchants at least tolerate him. I can't imagine why; he seems rather unpleasant."" C-3PO tilts his upper body, which you take to be the rough equivalent of cocking his head. ""I overheard him mention he is expecting a representative of a pirate gang. A Rodian, as I recall. He apparently owes this Rodian quite a lot of credits.""\n\nC-3PO turns to Vinto. ""I actually thought you might have been him.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_LOOK,"Maybe this Rodian can help us."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_SOMETHINGELSE,"Just threaten Brogo instead."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_VINTO_PLAN,"Have Vinto pretend to be the Rodian."
ENCOUNTER_20_SEARCH_RODIAN,"[i]You start asking questions and pressing a few credits into palms.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_20_SEARCH_RODIAN_GREAT_SUCCESS,"[i]You split up and ask around. Though you don't find the Rodian himself, you discover that he's definitely got a reputation around the shadowport. His name is Heeta, and he has a fondness for using ion thrusters as persuasive tools.\n\nWhat's more, you learn that Heeta has been waylaid on Nar Shaddaa, but that he sometimes sends others in his stead.{0}[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_SEARCH_RODIAN_SUCCESS,"[i]You split up and ask around, and though you don't find the Rodian himself, you discover that he's definitely got a reputation around the shadowport. His name is Heeta, and he has a fondness for using ion thrusters as persuasive tools.{0}[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_SEARCH_RODIAN_FAILURE,"[i]You split up and ask around, but no one will say anything about the Rodian.\n\nC-3PO shuffles up to you, a brutish Aqualish in tow. ""I may have found someone who can help us!"" the protocol droid announces. He motions toward the Aqualish.\n\n""You lookin' for Heeta?"" the alien grunts.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_MESSENGERS,"Let's pretend we're with Heeta."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_PROTECTORS,"Let's offer Brogo our help against Heeta."
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_WELL,"Well, we'd like to..."
ENCOUNTER_20_SUCKER_PUNCH,"[i]It turns out this was a rhetorical question, as the Aqualish hits you in the face, hard. ""Heeta said, anyone come lookin' for him, I take care of them,"" the thug growls as he draws a blaster. It looks like he has backup.\n\nYou dive for cover as blaster fire erupts. A stray bolt hits a power terminal; the lights go out and the shutters on the viewports slam down, cutting off all light.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests  or . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_20_DECEPTION_MURNE,"With Murne's penchant for misdirecting your adversaries, you have a good shot at convincing Brogo you work for Heeta."

ENCOUNTER_20_SUCKER_PUNCH_SUCCESS,"[i]Blaster bolts zip past you as you push C-3PO out of harm's way. ""Oh my! I'm done for!"" the droid squeals, despite no blaster bolts coming even close to singing his gold finish.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_SUCKER_PUNCH_FAILURE,"[i]Blaster bolts zip past you as you try to get C-3PO out of harm's way. A few shots crackle against his plating. ""Oh my! I'm done for!"" the droid squeals as you shove him behind some storage crates.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_MOVE!!,"Get the droid before we're shot to pieces!"

ENCOUNTER_20_UNDER_FIRE_BOTH,"[i]You dive into the safety of Brogo's stall. ""You came back for us! Thank the maker!"" C-3PO croons as you set to work on his restraining bolt. R2-D2 warbles in anticipation.[/i]\n\nAll heroes test . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_20_COSTUMES,"[i]If you're going to pull a fast one on Brogo, you'll want to look the part. With the market offering such a mishmash of well-used detritus, you can probably cobble together new outfits quickly.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_FIND_COSTUMES,"Find some convincing disguises."
ENCOUNTER_20_THREATEN_BROGO,"[i]You decide to cut to the chase. You demand that Brogo hands over the droids...or else.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_20_BROGO_DRAWS,"[i]""What? How dare you threaten me!? In my own home!"" Brogo's voice is shaky and he flaps deeper into his stall. He draws a scattergun from behind a shelf and fires wildly in your direction. He doesn't hit anything, but the sound of weapons fire is like a match to a powder keg; throughout the market, criminals and ne'er-do-wells draw their own blasters, unsure of who started the shooting but determined not to go down in it.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_BROGO_COWERS,"[i]With a terrified scream, Brogo retreats into his stall and takes cover behind a pile of junk. “Stay back!” he shouts. “I’m armed!” He fires a scattergun blast into the air as a warning, but the sound of weapons fire is like a match to a powder keg; throughout the market, criminals and ne'er-do-wells draw their own blasters, unsure of who started the shooting but determined not to go down in it.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_MOVE!!!,"Rescue the droids!"
ENCOUNTER_20_RESTRAINING_BOLT_SUCCESS,"[i]You slice {0} in record time. You're already moving when Brogo comes at you with his scattergun. ""Stop!

ENCOUNTER_20_RESTRAINING_BOLT_FAILURE,"[i]Slicing {0} takes more effort than you'd expected. From within his stall, Brogo levels his scattergun. ""Those are my droids!"" Finally your work pays off as you overcome {0}.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_RESTRAINING_BOLT_FAILURE_JARROD,"[i]Slicing {0} takes more effort than you'd expected. From within his stall, Brogo takes aim with his scattergun. ""I found those droids, fair and square!""\n\nJarrod acts quickly to buy the group more time. Dodging toward some of Brogo's other junked droids, he rips open maintenance panels and splices wires until the droids power up.

ENCOUNTER_20_THREEPIO_DEFEATED_2,"[i]Despite your best efforts, C-3PO takes a hard hit from a blaster, knocking him to the ground. ""Oh no! I'm done for!"" he moans as he flails. Though he's still functional, it looks like one of his legs has locked up. You haul the beleaguered protocol droid back to your ship as you return fire on your pursuers.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_BROGO_FAILURE_ARTOO,"[i]Shots from Brogo's scattergun ricochet off R2-D2's dome, prompting the astromech to warble in distress. You fire at Brogo, forcing the Toydarian to hover lower for cover as you scramble back to your ship.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_BROGO_FAILURE_THREEPIO,"[i]Shots from Brogo's scattergun ricochet off C-3PO's plating, prompting a flurry of pessimistic complaints from the protocol droid. You fire at Brogo, forcing the Toydarian to hover lower for cover as you scramble back to your ship.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_PLAYER_MHD,"Offer to trade MHD-19 for the two droids."
ENCOUNTER_20_BROGO_MHD,"[i]Brogo looks MHD-19 up and down and scowls. ""Looks modified. Probably not even memory wiped!"" He crosses his arms over his chest indignantly. ""Not worth the trouble.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_20_MASQUERADE,"[i]With Vinto wearing a ""new,"" tattered overcoat found several stalls down, and a very well-appointed eyepatch, you return to Brogo's stall.

""Give me an hour,"" she says, ""and if you don't hear from me in that time, you can break comm silence.""\n\n""We're your security, we're coming with you,"" says Anla Shou, a local rebel leader. Her small team is armed for a fight.\n\n""For the last time, Luk Hutsok is expecting me to come alone, so that is what I will do,"" Leia says authoritatively as she begins to descend the ship's boarding ramp. ""Remember, one hour. No sooner.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_2,"[i]As time passes, Anla grows increasingly anxious. ""This is taking too long!"" she bursts out after forty minutes. ""That snake probably alerted the Empire. They could be on their way now!""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_2A,"Calm down. There's still time."
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_2B,"Why would he do that?"
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_2C,"The Imperials could be here already!"
ENCOUNTER_23_3A,"[i]""Don't tell me to calm down,"" Anla glares at you. ""I'm calling her comlink."" Anla tries several times to get a response from Leia, but none is forthcoming. ""That's it, grab your gear,"" Anla barks to her compatriots. ""We're going in after her.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_3B,"[i]""Because he's a greedy slime!"" Anla growls. ""He probably listened to Leia's proposal and decided he could make more by turning her over to the Empire. I'm calling her comlink."" Anla pulls out a comlink and activates it. She tries several minutes to get a response from Leia, but none is forthcoming. ""That's it, grab your gear,"" Anla barks to her compatriots. ""We're going in after her.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_3C,"[i]Anla's eyes grow wide at the suggestion. ""I'm calling her comlink."" Anla pulls out a comlink and activates it. She tries several minutes to get a response from Leia, but none is forthcoming. ""That's it, grab your gear,"" Anla barks to her compatriots. ""We're going in after her.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_3A,"Leia said to wait an hour."
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_3B,"Let's go!"
ENCOUNTER_23_4A,"[i]""I don't care,"" Anla replies. ""She didn't respond, so we're going in for her. You can come, or you can sit here and do nothing. The choice is yours.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_4A_A,"We're with you."
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_4A_B,"We're staying here."
ENCOUNTER_23_PLAYER_4A_C,"You're not going anywhere."
ENCOUNTER_23_5A,"[i]Grabbing your gear, you follow Anla's team toward the front door of the mansion. Two private security guards stand at the door. When you approach, one guard orders you to stop. Anla quickly draws her pistol and fires one bolt straight into the guard's chest, dropping him in mid-stride. The other guard quickly reacts, training her blaster on Anla.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_PLAYER_A,"Warn Anla."
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_PLAYER_B,"Stun the guard."
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_PLAYER_C,"Kill the guard."
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_PLAYER_D,"Do nothing."
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_A,"[i]You shout a warning to Anla, who turns and shoots down the second guard. Anla gives you a brief nod of appreciation.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_B,"[i]You quickly take the second guard down, carefully avoiding lethal force. She is, after all, just doing her job. Anla levels her blaster at the unconscious guard, but you push her weapon aside.\n\n""Fine,"" Anla says, ""but if she wakes up and calls for help, that's on you.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_C,"[i]You act quickly to take the second guard down for good. You don't want her calling for backup. Anla nods in approval.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5A_D,"[i]The second guard shoots at Anla, catching her in the shoulder. The other rebels quickly return fire and drop the guard.\n\n""Blast it!"" Anla curses. ""Where was my backup there?"" She looks angrily at you, but also at her team, one of whom gives her a bacta injection near her injury. ""Don't let it happen again!""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5B,"[i]You stay behind on the ship as Anla takes her team inside. About ten minutes later, your comlink chirps. ""I could use your help in here,"" Leia says when you answer. ""Second floor, first door on the left."" Collecting your weapons, you head into the mansion.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5B2,"[i]You enter through the front door, passing the bodies of two private security guards. You make your way to the second floor to find Leia and Anla in a large meeting hall. Across the table, a pair of Neimoidians, are held at gunpoint by Anla's team.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C,"[i]""And who's going to make us?"" Anla asks menacingly. ""You?""[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_BEST,"[i]You tussle with Anla's group, neither side going for their weapons. You come out on top with only a few bruises and a bloodied nose on either side. You disarm Anla's team and lock them in the ship's bunk to keep them from causing further trouble until you hear back from Leia.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_BEST_2,"[i]The hour passes, and you are considering whether Anla was right about going in after Leia when your comlink beeps. Leia has secured an agreement with the Neimoidian arms dealer to funnel weapons to the Rebellion. When she returns to the ship, you tell her about the scuffle.\n\n""Anla has a reputation for being a bit of a hothead,"" Leia replies with a sigh. ""You showed good judgment in keeping her from doing anything rash. Had she burst in with guns blazing, I surely would not have been able to seal the deal. The Rebel Alliance owes you a debt. If you ever need my help, I will be glad to return the favor.""[/i]\n\nYou gained 10 fame."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE,"[i]You tussle with Anla's group, neither side going for their weapons. As your team gets the upper hand, one of Anla's people lunges at you with a vibro-dagger. You instinctively dodge and the dagger plunges into Anla's stomach. The rebel panics after realizing what he's done, but you still knock him out. Anla staggers back against a bulkhead and slumps to the floor, the dagger still deep in her abdomen. If she doesn't get medical help quickly, she could die.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_2,"[i]Anla bleeds profusely from her stab wound. If you don't act quickly, she could die.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_PLAYER_A,"Use a medpac."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_A,"[i]You remove the vibro-dagger and use a medpac to try to stabilize Anla's condition.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_A_PASS,"[i]You apply a bacta injection to the wound and bandage it up. Anla appears to be stable for now, but will need professional care soon.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_A_PASS_2,"[i]A few minutes later, you finally receive a signal from Leia. Luk Hutsok, the Nemoidian arms dealer, has agreed to funnel weapons to the Rebellion.\n\n""What happened here?"" Leia exclaims when she returns to find the injured Anla. You explain the situation, and Leia shoots a glare at the man responsible for the stabbing. ""Well, we'd better get her some help."" She puts a gentle hand on Anla's head. ""Oh, Anla, why didn't you follow orders?"" The wounded rebel appears apologetic, but doesn't have the strength to say anything.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_A_PASS_3,"[i]""You did the right thing keeping Anla from rushing into the negotiations,"" Leia says. ""Luk Hutsok does a lot of business with the Empire and was understandably reluctant to play both sides. Anla would have blown any chance at a deal. If you ever need me to return the favor, just let me know.""[/i]\n\nYou gained 5 fame."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_A_FAIL,"[i]You bandage the wound and give Anla a shot for the pain, but she continues to bleed profusely. If you don't get her help quickly, she will bleed out.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_PLAYER_B,"Take her to a local medical facility."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_B,"[i]You attempt to contact Leia, but still get no response. You hesitate just a moment before deciding that the potential danger to Leia is outweighed by the very real threat of Anla bleeding out. You tell your pilot to get to the nearest medical facility quickly. With some falsified identification provided by Anla's people, she is admitted to the facility. Her people to stay behind as you return to retrieve Leia.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_B2,"[i]On your way back, Leia delivers the good news: the Neimoidian arms dealer has agreed to funnel weapons to the Rebellion. You tell her what happened with Anla. ""I understand,"" she said. ""You made the right call. Anla has a reputation for being hotheaded, but you showed good judgement. If you ever need my help, I will gladly provide it.[/i]\n\nYou gained 5 fame."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_PLAYER_C,"Wait for Leia's return."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_C,"[i]Your mission is more important than one life, and leaving Leia behind would put her in unnecessary danger. Still, you feel pangs of guilt as Anla bleeds on the floor, her companions doing what they can to keep her conscious.\n\nThe hour passes, and you are considering whether Anla was right about going in after Leia when your comlink beeps. Leia has secured an agreement with the Neimoidian arms dealer to funnel weapons to the Rebellion. You inform Leia of the situation on the ship, and she promises to return as quickly as she can.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_C2,"[i]By the time Leia returns to the ship, Anla has died from blood loss. Leia kneels down next to the young woman's body and runs her hand over Anla's face, closing her eyes. ""Blast it, Anla,"" Leia says quietly. ""Why didn't you listen to me?"" Leia turns back to you.\n\n""Anla may have been a hothead, but she was one of us. The Rebellion is worse off for her death. I know it was an accident, but we cannot fight amongst ourselves when we face such overwhelming odds."" The sting of Leia's words lingers, even after she has gone.[/i]\n\nYou lost 5 fame."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_PLAYER_D,"Have MHD-19 stabilize her."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_D,"[i]MHD-19 jumps into action and carries Anla to a bunk. The droid removes the vibro-dagger from Anla's abdomen and sets about repairing the damage. MHD is in the middle of the surgery when Leia calls. She has convinced the Neimoidian arms dealer to funnel weapons to the Rebellion. You fill her in on what happened, and she promises to hurry back to the ship.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_MIDDLE_D2,"[i]When Leia returns to the ship, MHD-19 has finished Anla's surgery, and the young woman is recuperating in the ship's bunk.\n\n""Thank you for what you did for Anla,"" Leia says to MHD-19. ""You saved her life today. You all showed good judgement in trying to keep Anla from acting rashly. Had she run in, guns blazing, I surely wouldn't have been able to close the deal. The Rebel Alliance owes you a debt, and I will be glad to return the favor.""[/i]\n\nYou gained 5 fame."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_WORST,"[i]You tussle with Anla's group, neither side going for their weapons. Anla's team overpowers you and leaves the ship. It has become apparent that you won't be able to stop them.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_WORST_PLAYER_A,"Accompany them inside."
ENCOUNTER_23_5C_WORST_PLAYER_B,"Wait on the ship."
ENCOUNTER_23_6A,"[i]Inside the mansion, an unarmed Nemoidian stands in the large entry foyer. Anla grabs the Neimoidian and demands to be taken to Leia. The Neimoidian wisely agrees.\n\nYou ascend to a luxurious meeting hall on the second floor, where Leia sits with another Neimoidian at an expansive table. ""What is the meaning of this?"" Luk Hutsok demands."
ENCOUNTER_23_6A_PLAYER_A,"Meeting's over."
ENCOUNTER_23_6A_PLAYER_B,"Sorry to disturb you."
ENCOUNTER_23_6A_A,"[i]""Like hell it is,"" Leia responds brusquely. ""What are you doing here?""\n\n""You didn't respond to my calls,"" Anla says. ""We thought you might be in trouble.""\n\n""If this is the way the Rebel Alliance operates, then I certainly cannot be involved,"" Luk Hutsok interjects. ""Your associate is right. This meeting is over. Leave now."""
ENCOUNTER_23_6A_A2,"[i]Anla points her blaster at Luk. ""Sit down,"" she says coldly. ""We're not done here.""\n\n""This is not how we negotiate,"" Leia says to Anla. ""Put down the blaster and let me fix this mess you've made.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_6A_B,"[i]You explain to Leia that you were concerned about her safety.\n\n""Alright, fish-face,"" Anla says to Luk Hutsok, seemingly forgetting why you had come, ""we're done talking. You're going to give us what we want, or you're going to die."" She levels her blaster at the Neimoidian.\n\n""This is not how we negotiate,"" Leia says to Anla. ""Put down the blaster and let me fix this mess you've made.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_6B,"[i]""We've got a situation here,"" Leia says. ""Anla interrupted my negotiations to wave her gun in Luk Hutsok's face."" She motions toward one of the Neimoidians sitting at the table.\n\n""People like him only respond to threats,"" Anla counters. ""You couldn't convince him to cooperate, Princess, but I will."" Anla glowers intensely at the Neimoidian, her blaster pointing at his head.\n\n""This is not how we negotiate,"" Leia says to Anla. ""Go back to the ship and let me fix this mess you've made.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_6_PLAYER_A,"Give Anla a chance, Princess."
ENCOUNTER_23_6_PLAYER_B,"Listen to her, Anla."
ENCOUNTER_23_6_PLAYER_C,"Disarm Anla."
ENCOUNTER_23_7A,"[i]Leia is displeased, but realizes she is outnumbered. ""So what's it going to be, fish-face?"" Anla asks Luk Hutsok. ""You going to help us, or are you going to die today?""\n\n""If the Empire discovers I am selling arms to the Rebellion, they will do far worse to me than you can,"" Luk responds. Anla catches Luk glancing in the direction of the other Neimoidian at the table.\n\n""We'll see about that,"" Anla says, pointing her blaster at the other Neimoidian.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_7A2,"[i]""She is just a servant,"" Luk answers calmly. ""She means nothing to me.""\n\n""Does she?"" Anla asks. ""Not many people put their servants in their family portraits."" She nods to a painting on one wall of the room. Luk doesn't turn to look; he only continues to stare Anla down.\n\n""Stop this madness!"" Leia shouts, but Anla keeps her eyes fixed on Luk.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_7B,"[i]""We don't have time for talk,"" Anla hisses. ""Fish-face here surely has more security on the way as we speak.""\n\n""Then we leave,"" Leia says. ""We accept failure and retreat.""\n\n""Not this time,"" Anla says. ""This time, we stand up and fight."" Anla's finger tightens on the trigger of her blaster, which is pointed at Luk Hutsok's head.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_7_PLAYER_A,"Disarm Anla."
ENCOUNTER_23_7_PLAYER_B,"Do nothing."
ENCOUNTER_23_8A,"[i]You attempt to disarm Anla before anyone else gets hurt.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the  rolled by the hero with the most ."
ENCOUNTER_23_8A_PASS,"[i]You force Anla's arm upward and her shot misses above the Neimoidian's head. You pull Anla's blaster from her grip, twisting her arm behind her back in the same smooth motion. The rest of your squad turn their weapons toward Anla's team to discourage them from doing anything rash.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_8A_A_FAIL,"[i]You rush at Anla, but she pulls the trigger, sending a bolt of energy into the Neimoidian's chest. Luk rushes to the other Neimoidian's side as she falls from her chair. You rip the blaster out of Anla's hand.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_8A_B_FAIL,"[i]You rush at Anla, but she pulls the trigger. The other Neimoidian dives in front of Luk Hutsok. The blaster bolt strikes her in the chest and she falls to the floor. You rip the blaster out of Anla's hand.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_8B_A,"[i]Anla pulls the trigger, sending a bolt of energy into the Neimoidian's chest. Luk rushes to the other Neimoidian's side as she falls out of her chair. Leia angrily grabs the blaster out of Anla's hand.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_8B_B,"[i]As Anla pulls the trigger, the other Neimoidian dives in front of Luk Hutsok and takes the blaster bolt to the chest before falling to the floor. Leia angrily grabs the blaster out of Anla's hand.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_9A,"[i]With Anla and her people neutralized, Leia turns to Luk Hutsok. ""I apologize for my...associate's behavior,"" Leia begins.\n\n""Get out of my house,"" Luk replies slowly, his tone one of quiet, seething rage. Leia simply nods, then motions for everyone to leave.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_9B,"[i]Luk cradles the wounded Neimoidian in his arms, his face full of anguish. ""I'm sorry, father,"" she says before going limp in Luk's arms. Luk's head hangs for a long moment before he takes a long look at each of the Rebels in the room, as if memorizing their faces.\n\n""You have made an enemy today,"" Luk says slowly, with quiet, seething rage. ""I will spend my last credit to see each of you dead.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_23_10A_BEST,"[i]Back on the ship, you lock Anla and her people up in the crew bunk. Leia wearily drops into a seat in the rec area. ""That could have gone better,"" she mumbles sarcastically. ""But, it could have been worse. Thank you for stopping Anla from escalating things more than she already did. When you're an underdog like the Rebellion, you can't always choose who is on your side, but you seem to be my kind of Rebels.""[/i]\n\nYou gained {0} fame."

ENCOUNTER_23_10B,"[i]""We have to kill him, too,"" Anla says, looking at each of you for support. ""Alive, he is a threat to us. Dead, he could be replaced by someone friendlier to the Rebellion.""\n\n""No,"" Leia replies. ""Enough blood has been spilled. Too much blood.""\n\n""He sells weapons to our enemy,"" Anla insists.

ENCOUNTER_25_2,"[i]Lando explains the scheme: you will go to the Capital City Casino to find a mark, someone to buy the pig without inspecting it too carefully.

ENCOUNTER_25_3,"[i]Your team will need to divide up into two roles: the hustlers and the contrarian. The hustlers' job will be to convince the mark that this pig will make them rich.

ENCOUNTER_29_INTRO,"[i]You land alongside the parked [/i]Ghost[i] at a resistance settlement on Ryloth. The esteemed Rebel leader, Hera Syndulla, helps you from your ship. ""We're glad you offered to help,"" she says with a warm handshake. ""When we lose food shipments to the Empire, people suffer.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_INTRO_2,"[i]An orange astromech swirls around, clearly inspecting you. After examining your pockets a little too closely, it reaches for your weapon.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOSE_SWAT,"Swat the droid's mechanical arm away."
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOSE_SHOW,"Show the droid your weapon."

ENCOUNTER_29_SWAT,"[i]You swat the droid away from your weapon. He spins and beeps, pouting, before noticing Hera scowling at him. ""Mind your manners, Chopper,"" she commands. ""They're here to help."" The astromech shrugs his arms innocently before reversing into your leg and finally rolling away.\n\n""He has to warm up to new people,"" Hera apologizes. ""But he's finished prepping the [/i]Ghost[i]. Hop aboard and let's hit those Imperials!""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOW,"[i]The droid beeps excitedly as you show him how to handle your weapon. When you let him hold it, he ecstatically spins in circles before rolling over to Hera and holding the weapon up to her.\n\n""No, Chopper, you can't get one,"" Hera explains patiently. ""Now give it back and let's hit those Imperials!"" Chopper reluctantly hands your weapon back but happily escorts you aboard the [/i]Ghost[i].[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_START,"[i]You disembark the [/i]Ghost[i] a safe distance from the Imperial hangar where the supplies were taken and approach on foot under the cover of night.\n\nCrouched behind a boulder, you watch a stormtrooper patrol pass the facility's entrance, which is defended by a series of laser turrets.

ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_RUN,"Make a break for it!"
ENCOUNTER_29_OBSERVE,"[i]You help restrain a disgruntled Chopper as a second patrol makes its rounds. ""Good call,"" Hera whispers. ""If we act rashly, we risk capture. We need to learn the patrol routes."" Chopper crosses his arms and refuses to help.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."

ENCOUNTER_29_OBSERVE_FAIL,

ENCOUNTER_29_EVADE,"[i]You come to a shipping terminal and Hera starts scouring the shipping records. Above the stockpiled warehouse floor, you spot another guard checking a security terminal in small office. Chopper extends his spark projector, already crackling, but Hera cuts him off. ""We do this quietly,"" she advises. ""We don't want to risk a lockdown.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_LOGS,"Quietly search for the missing cargo."
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_SHOCK,"Shock the guard!"

ENCOUNTER_29_LOGS,"[i]Hera finds some promising entries and you stealthily navigate the cluttered hangar, checking shipments. You find the missing cargo stacked near an Imperial [/i]Zeta[i]-class shuttle. Chopper looks the shuttle over and triumphantly raises his arms.\n\n""Chopper, we already have a ship,"" Hera says. ""Besides, I need you to jam the Imperial channels so the Twi'lek resistance can airlift us out."" The droid doesn't seem to trust others, and looks to you for support.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_JAM,"Let's stick to the plan. Jam the guard channels."
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_STEAL,"The shuttle's right here. Let's take it!"

ENCOUNTER_29_JAM,"[i]Chopper gives an uncharacteristically cooperative trill, then spins his head and makes static noises. ""Seriously?"" Hera sighs.

I need you to head back to that shipping terminal and try to override the guard channels.""[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_29_JAM_PASS,"[i]You quietly disengage the facility's alarms, then return to Hera. ""Excellent,"" she says. ""Now keep your heads down!""\n\nYou hit the floor as a Twi'lek ship blasts through the hangar's corrugated roof. Several Twi'leks rappel down and help you quickly load the cargo. The Imperial patrols, unable to get a distress signal through, simply watch as you escape the Empire's grasp.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_JAM_PASS_2,"[i]""I like Rebels who keep calm under pressure, and come through in a pinch,"" Hera says, hugging each of you back at the settlement. ""You've eased a lot of suffering on Ryloth. Let me know if I can ever repay your effort.""\n\nChopper sulks behind Hera, preoccupied by annoying a baby blurrg lizard. Worried about the droid's penchant for mischief, you double-check your pockets one last time before leaving.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_JAM_FAIL,"[i]You try to disable the security system, but trip a hidden alarm. As klaxons blare, a Twi'lek ship blasts through the corrugated hangar roof.\n\nImperial forces attack your position, but Chopper gleefully returns fire with the [/i]Zeta[i]-class shuttle's laser cannons. Under his reckless protection, you get a few crates onboard the escape craft and leave before reinforcements arrive.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_JAM_FAIL_2,"[i]""I like Rebels who keep calm under pressure,"" Hera says back at the settlement. ""You bungled the escape, but we learn from our mistakes and come back stronger. Let me know if I can ever repay your effort.""\n\nChopper sulks behind Hera, already modifying his new [/i]Zeta[i]-class shuttle.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL,"[i]Chopper didn't wait for a decision. He clicks and waves at Hera as he disappears into the cockpit. ""Sometimes he's right,"" Hera concedes. ""Start moving crates!""[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_PASS,"[i]You get all of the crates loaded by the time Chopper slices through the shuttle's security. The still-conscious Imperial guard visibly panics as the engines flare. After he picks his hat back up off the ground, he slams his alarm.\n\nImperial forces flood the hangar, but Chopper gleefully blasts a hole in the roof and the shuttle disappears into Ryloth's night sky.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_PASS_2,"[i]Back at the settlement, Hera hugs everyone goodbye. ""You showed both patience and a willingness to act,"" she compliments you. ""We could use more Rebels like you.""\n\nChopper stops pestering a baby blurrg lizard long enough to wave goodbye.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_FAIL,"[i]You've only loaded a few crates when Chopper starts the engines. The unfortunately still-conscious Imperial guard visibly panics and slams his alarm.\n\nDefense turrets begin to tear through the shuttle's hull, and before you can grab more supplies, Chopper miraculously pilots the burning wreck straight through the hangar roof and into the Ryloth night sky.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_FAIL_2,"[i]Back at the settlement, Hera takes stock of the meager raid. ""There's enough here to do some good, but we should have stuck to the plan,"" she lightly chastises . ""But you're learning. Through our failures we grow stronger.""\n\nOver her shoulder, Chopper mourns the wrecked [/i]Zeta[i]-class shuttle, saluting it as it burns.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_RUN_PASS,"[i]You dash into the facility moments before a second patrol rounds the corner. Chopper's rocket-boosted charge carries him down the hallway, where he bowls over an Imperial officer as he exits the control station.\n\nWhen you catch up to the droid, he's rummaging through the unconscious officer's coat.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_STOP,"Stay focused, Chopper."
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_SEARCH,"What's he got?"
ENCOUNTER_29_SEARCH,"[i]Despite Hera's obvious disapproval, Chopper thoroughly searches the officer's pockets. After a while, he triumphantly holds up a code cylinder. Relieved, Hera grabs the cylinder and heads for the console.\n\nWhen she turns her back, Chopper hands you a share of the loot.[/i]\n\nYou gained 25 credits."
ENCOUNTER_29_USE,"[i]Hera digs through the Imperial records, looking for the Rebel cargo. ""There!"" she exclaims, pointing to a stack of crates near an Imperial [/i]Zeta[i]-class shuttle. Chopper looks the shuttle over and triumphantly raises his arms.\n\n""Chopper, we already have a ship,"" Hera says. ""Besides, I need you to deactivate the aerial defenses so the Twi'lek resistance can airlift us out."" The droid doesn't seem to trust the others, and looks to you for support.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_DEACTIVATE,"Deactivate the defenses, Chopper."
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOOSE_STEAL_2,"The shuttle's right there. Let's take it!"

ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_2,"[i]Chopper blitzes toward the shuttle as you approach the cargo. He clicks and waves at Hera as he disappears into the cockpit. ""I can't handle him right now,"" Hera mutters. ""Please go with him and make sure he doesn't get into more trouble; I'll load the crates.""[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_PASS_3,"[i]Chopper is laser-focused on taking the shuttle for a joyride, while you fully disable the shuttle's security. The droid grumpily gives the pilot's seat to Hera, but regains his enthusiasm as he takes the guns.\n\n""Hold tight,"" Hera warns. ""This could get bumpy.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_PASS_4,"[i]Chopper gleefully blasts a hole in the hangar, and Imperial turrets swivel in response. Hera sends the ship rocketing into the sky, dodging the fire as best as she can. Chopper knocks out a few of the emplacements, but the shuttle sustains heavy damage before lumbering to the safety of the Twi'lek settlement.\n\n""We've helped a lot of people,"" Hera says, ""but I think I'll look elsewhere for covert help in the future."" Chopper ignores her pessimism, giving each of you emphatic high-fives.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_FAIL_3,"[i]Chopper quickly starts the engines, but you couldn't disable the security protocols. As alarms blare, Hera jumps aboard just as Chopper gleefully blasts a hole in the hangar roof.\n\nYou brace yourselves as turrets tear through the shuttle's hull. Despite the fire, Hera miraculously pilots the burning wreck straight through the hangar roof and into the Ryloth night sky.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_STEAL_FAIL_4,"[i]Back at the settlement, Hera takes stock of the meager raid. ""There's enough here to do some good, but we should have stuck to the plan,"" she chastises .\n\nAfter she leaves, Chopper gives you an affectionate bump and access to a comm channel he seems to have set up for himself.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_DEACTIVATE,"[i]Chopper reluctantly agrees, but only if you help, instead of Hera. ""Seriously?"" Hera sighs. The droid blips sarcastically, mimicking Hera's incredulous posture. ""Fine,"" she relents, stepping away from the console.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_29_DEACTIVATE_PASS,"[i]Together with Chopper, you quietly disengage the facility's defenses. ""Excellent,"" Hera nods. ""Now keep your heads down!""\n\nYou hit the floor as a Twi'lek ship blasts through the hangar's corrugated roof. Several Twi'leks rappel down and help you quickly load the cargo. The Imperial patrols' weapons are ineffective against the ship, and the troopers simply watch as you escape the Empire's grasp.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_DEACTIVATE_PASS_2,"[i]""You're headstrong, but you came through in a pinch,"" Hera says, hugging each of you back at the settlement. ""You've eased a lot of suffering on Ryloth. Let me know if I can ever repay your effort.""\n\nChopper waves an Imperial cap as you board your shuttle, and you check your own pockets one last time, just in case.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_DEACTIVATE_FAIL,"[i]You try to disable the Imperial turrets, but trip a hidden alarm. As klaxons blare, a Twi'lek ship blasts through the corrugated hangar roof.\n\nThe ship takes heavy fire until Chopper single-handedly overrides the base's power routines. Under the cover of total darkness, you get a few crates onboard the escape craft and leave before reinforcements arrive.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_DEACTIVATE_FAIL_2,"[i]""That was close, but everyone survived,"" Hera says back at the settlement. ""But we learn from our mistakes and come back stronger.""\n\nChopper dons his new Imperial cap and salutes you before disappearing back into the [/i]Ghost[i].[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_FOCUS,"[i]Chopper looks to Hera, who scowls disapprovingly at the droid with her hands on her hips. Chopper throws his arms up in frustration, muttering a whir of frustrated blips.\n\nHera gently props the unconscious guard against the wall before turning her attention to the security console. ""Now, where is that cargo?"" she murmurs to herself as she pours through shipping logs.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL,"[i]""Ah, there we go,"" Hera says, pointing at the screen. She looks out over the hangar floor, and directs you to a pile of crates in the corner.\n\nYou determine that these are the crates you're looking for, and Hera pulls out a heavily modified beam-cutter. ""Now we just need to get through this wall,"" she says, handing you the tool.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."

ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_FAIL,"[i]You injure yourself with the beam-cutter, and Chopper chuckles as he effortlessly slices through the wall on his own. You carry as much as you can through the hole and into the night.\n\nYou only take a few steps before a blindingly bright spotlight flashes on and swivels to the hole in the facility wall.\n\n""Leave the cargo!"" Hera commands. You sprint to safety before the spotlight can catch you.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_FAIL_2,"[i]You return to the settlement empty-handed. Hera recounts the failed mission to the Twi'leks while Chopper sulks on the [/i]Ghost[/i]. You board your ship and quietly leave Ryloth without saying goodbye.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_HERA,"[i]Hera shows you how to smoothly operate the beam-cutter, and with some effort, you make it through the facility wall.\n\nYou carefully slide the panel aside, and stealthily lead your waiting Twi'lek allies to the breach.\n\nAfter a few trips, a stormtrooper patrol spots you. As spotlights flicker on throughout the facility, you decide to quit while you're ahead and retreat into the night.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_HERA_2,"[i]Back at the settlement, Hera hugs everyone goodbye. ""You helped a lot of people today,"" she compliments you. ""We could use more Rebels like you.""\n\nAs you board your ship, you notice Chopper pestering a baby blurrg lizard on the edge of the settlement.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_CHOPPER,"[i]Chopper is amused as you struggle with the beam-cutter, but together you make it through the wall.\n\nYou carefully slide the panel aside, and stealthily lead your waiting Twi'lek allies to the breach.\n\nAfter a few trips, a stormtrooper patrol spots you. As spotlights flicker on throughout the facility, you decide to quit while you're ahead and retreat into the night.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_CHOPPER_2,"[i]As you leave the settlement, Chopper gives you an affectionate bump. ""I think he's warmed up to you,"" Hera says, with a smile.\n\nHera turns to help distribute the supplies among the Twi'leks, but Chopper stays and waves until you've left Ryloth.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_HIGH,"[i]You expertly cut through the wall. Chopper does the same, and seems to enjoy the race, though he briefly pouts when he loses.\n\nYou carefully set the sliced wall panel up to mask the hole, and stealthily lead your waiting Twi'lek allies in ferrying supplies between stormtrooper patrols.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_WALL_HIGH_2,"[i]Back at the settlement, Hera hugs everyone goodbye. ""You showed bravery, but also kept your cool,"" she compliments you. ""We could use more Rebels like you.""\n\nChopper stops pestering a baby blurrg lizard just long enough to wave goodbye as your board your ship.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_RUN_FAIL,"[i]You're almost through the entrance when a second patrol rounds the corner. ""Stop! Rebels!"" the captain shouts, leveling his blaster. The gate slams shut, and Chopper bounces off the reinforced durasteel. The base's defense turrets open fire on you.\n\nHera, still behind the rock, fires off a flare and shouts, ""You'd better be thankful I had a plan B!""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_FLARE,"[i]A Twi'lek resistance fighter ship roars into view. Fighters rappel to battle as the ship's guns suppress the now swarming stormtrooper patrols. Undeterred by the lethal firefight, Chopper carries on decrypting the Imperial gate controls.\n\n""Get out!"" Hera shouts. ""We can't hold the Empire for long!""[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOSE_RETREAT,"Run for cover!"
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOSE_DECRYPT,"Bypass the gate."

ENCOUNTER_29_DECRYPT,"[i]You stay put and are quickly pinned down by Imperial fire. Unable to leave, you help Chopper with the gate.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_29_DECRYPT_PASS,"[i]The gate unlocks briefly, and Chopper darts into the base. You duck to roll under the door, but it slams shut, trapping you outside again.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_DECRYPT_PASS_2,"[i]A rocket strikes the Twi'lek ship, sending it crashing to the ground. The remaining forces turn to retreat from the overpowering fire from Imperial defense turrets, and not even Hera can convince them to help evacuate you.\n\nJust as you lose all hope, you hear a crash from inside the hangar, then several more explosions all around the facility. A TIE fighter wobbles around the battlefield, firing haphazardly at stormtroopers.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_DECRYPT_PASS_3,"[i]Now with a path to freedom, you sprint back to the [/i]Ghost[i], where you watch Chopper crash-land the stolen TIE.\n\nHera returns you to your ship, though she is clearly upset about the injuries her kinsfolk suffered for you. Chopper, however, seems in remarkable spirits. He offers you a scrap of the TIE as a souvenir, and waves as you leave the embattled Ryloth behind. [/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_DECRYPT_FAIL,"[i]Frustrated by the gate's security, Chopper turns his attention to the Imperial turrets. With comparatively little effort, he gains control of the front-facing weapon emplacements and lays down heavy suppressing fire.\n\nYou reach the safe perimeter as the turrets completely overheat. As they explode, Chopper rockets out to join you, singed and upset over the ordeal.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_DECRYPT_FAIL_2,"[i]You board the[/i]Ghost[i] and return to your ship.\n\nHera, upset over the failed mission and injuries to the Twi'leks, doesn't say another word to you, and Chopper aloofly repairs his damaged chassis as you quietly depart Ryloth.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_RETREAT,"[i]You take advantage of the cover fire and retreat to Hera's position behind the boulder. ""Where's Chopper?"" she asks. Peeking over the boulder, you scan the battlefield for the droid.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_29_RETREAT_PASS,"[i]Through the growing blaster smoke, you spot Chopper attempting to slice an Imperial turret. You fire on the stormtroopers advancing toward the droid, and within moments an unrelenting torrent of fire from Chopper's turret clears the Imperials.\n\nTaking advantage of the tactical foothold, the Twi'leks attack the facility directly.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_RETREAT_PASS_2,"[i]In the aftermath of the fierce firefight, you and Hera find Chopper looting Imperial officers. ""Not now, Chopper,"" Hera scolds. ""We have a limited window until reinforcements arrive.""\n\nTogether with the Twi'leks, you raid the Imperial supplies before retreating to the settlement.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_RETREAT_PASS_3,"[i]""You did well,"" Hera congratulates you. ""We all make mistakes, but we learn from them and grow stronger.""\n\nChopper grumpily warbles from behind a control panel. ""Yes,"" Hera assures him patronizingly. ""I'm sure you would have been better off on your own.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_RETREAT_FAIL,"[i]You see no trace of Chopper until he comes rocketing directly at you, partially on fire. He crashes into the dirt, then quickly extinguishes the fire before raising his arms and complaining to you.\n\nHera orders a full retreat, but the Twi'leks sustain casualties as you return to the [/i]Ghost[i] empty-handed.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK,"[i]A bolt of electricity arcs through the guard. He reaches toward his terminal before collapsing. As he falls, his outstretched hand grazes a control. Over Hera's shoulder, you see an alarm confirmation countdown appear on the screen. You rush to disable the impending alarm.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."

ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_FAIL,"[i]The countdown expires before you can stop it, and alarms blare throughout the hangar. ""We were so close,"" Hera laments. ""Well, let's get out while we can.""\n\nYou retreat to the [/i]Ghost[i] while patrols scour the area for intruders.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_FAIL_2,"[i]You return to the settlement empty-handed. ""I appreciate the effort,"" Hera says, ""but it's not just the thought that counts. When we fail, people suffer."" Chopper seems to have lost all interest in you, and pesters a baby blurrg lizard as you return to your ship.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_HIGH,"[i]You intercept the alarm call, and trace the routine deeper into the facility's security. As Chopper tries to convince Hera that he knows what he's doing, you permanently disable the facility's defenses.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_HIGH_2,"[i]Hera happily calls the Twi'leks in, and you escape with the cargo while the stormtroopers desperately fiddle with their turrets.\n\n""That went smoothly, considering the circumstances,"" Hera congratulates you. ""We can help a lot of people with these supplies.""\n\nAs you board your ship, Chopper high-fives you, and slips you the codes to his overly-encrypted channel.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_HERA,"[i]You intercept the alarm call with only a moment to spare. Hera wipes a bead of sweat from her brow, then returns to the console. ""Alright, our cargo should be in...that corner,"" she says, pointing to the back of the hangar. ""From now on, follow my lead.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_HERA_2,"[i]With Hera in the lead, you stealthily tag the cargo and escape the facility. ""See how much easier that was?"" she asks Chopper. He grumbles, morally defeated.\n\nWith a single call, a Twi'lek ship recovers the cargo and escapes before the Imperials know what hit them. ""That's how it's done!"" Hera exclaims. ""But you did well. I'd be happy to give you more pointers on your next mission,"" she offers.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_CHOPPER,"[i]You intercept the alarm call with only a moment to spare. Chopper slowly retracts his spark projector, showing just a hint of guilt. Hera wipes a bead of sweat from her brow, then returns to the console. ""Alright, our cargo should be in...that corner,"" she says, pointing to the back of the hangar. ""From now on, follow my lead.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_CHOPPER_2,"[i]With Hera in the lead, you stealthily tag the cargo and escape the facility. ""See how much easier that was?"" she asks Chopper. He grumbles, morally defeated.\n\nWith a single call, a Twi'lek ship recovers the cargo and escapes before the Imperials know what hit them. ""That's how it's done!"" Hera exclaims. ""But you did well."" Chopper waves goodbye as you leave, and later sends you access codes to his overly-encrypted comm channel.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_OBSERVE_FAIL,"[i]You watch for patrols, and cautiously advance after the next one passes. As you approach the gate, a single stormtrooper doubles back around the corner. He reaches for his blaster when electricity arcs across his armor. The stormtrooper falls to the ground, and Chopper waves from behind him.\n\n""Every once in a while, I remember why I keep you around,"" Hera says to the droid while wiping a bead of sweat from her brow.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_SHOCK_LOOT,"[i]Satisfied that you'd witnessed his heroism, Chopper starts rooting through the stormtrooper's possessions. ""Now's not the time, Chopper,"" Hera scolds. ""Get over here and open this door!"" The droid looks to you for a second opinion.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOSE_DOOR,"Hera's right. Let's head in."
ENCOUNTER_29_CHOOSE_STORMTROOPER,"What's he got on him?"

ENCOUNTER_29_STORMTROOPER,"[i]Chopper flips through ammunition, a flashlight, and some assorted personal effects before holding up a code cylinder. He excitedly wheels up to the gate, and instantly pops it open. Bowing to the best of his ability, he ushers Hera into the hangar. Only barely amused, she heads inside. When she passes, you notice Chopper slide some spare credits into a hidden compartment.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_STORM_CREDITS,"[i]Chopper flips through ammunition, a flashlight, and some assorted personal effects before holding up a code cylinder. He excitedly wheels up to the gate, and instantly pops it open. Bowing to the best of his ability, he ushers Hera into the hangar. Only barely amused, she heads inside. When she passes, Chopper slides some spare credits into your hand.[/i]\n\nYou gained 25 credits."
ENCOUNTER_29_TAG,"[i]Inside the hangar, Hera spots a terminal and Chopper quickly slices into the shipping logs. ""You help Chopper identify our cargo while I call in our allies,"" she instructs. You flit through the logs searching for the Rebel containers.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."

ENCOUNTER_29_TAG_PASS,"[i]With Chopper's help, you identify each of the impounded crates, tagging their location for the Twi'leks. When you're finished, you sneak back to the [/i]Ghost[i] where Hera gives the strike team the order to go.\n\nYou hear several loud explosions from the facility, then sirens blaring. You start to worry about the mission when the local resistance captain flies his ship over the [/i]Ghost[i] and gives you a thumbs up.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_TAG_PASS_2,"[i]As you leave the settlement, Chopper gives you an affectionate bump. ""I think he's warmed up to you,"" Hera says with a smile.\n\nHera turns to help distribute the supplies among the Twi'leks, but Chopper stays and waves until you've left Ryloth.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_TAG_FAIL,"[i]You identify about half of the impounded crates, tagging their location for the Twi'leks when Hera calls. ""You must have tripped a silent alarm,"" she warns. ""Additional patrols are headed your way. We're coming for the crates. Get out now!""\n\nYou run to safety and hear several loud explosions from the facility. As sirens blare, you thankfully see Hera and the [/i]Ghost[i] escape, though the ship has taken severe damage.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_TAG_FAIL_2,"[i]At the settlement, Hera busies herself distributing the meager supplies you recovered, while Chopper grumpily repairs the [/i]Ghost[i].\n\nYou leave Ryloth knowing you helped the Twi'leks, but sensing you could have done more.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_29_DOOR,"[i]Chopper throws the ammunition, a flashlight, and some assorted personal effects he'd already collected in the air with frustration. He grumbles all the way to the gate, and instantly pops it open. ""Thank you, Chopper,"" Hera says, painfully politely.\n\nChopper grumbles back toward his loot, but Hera pulls him into the base, skidding against his brake.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_HAUL,"[i]Inside, Chopper begrudgingly slices a security terminal and Hera tags the missing cargo crates. ""They'd already started unpacking it,"" Hera says worriedly. ""I'll need you to gather it back together while we shut down the alarms.""\n\nYou head down to the hangar floor and try to stealthily move the crates into a convenient pile in the center of the hangar.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."

ENCOUNTER_29_HAUL_PASS,"[i]You round up all of the crates and stack them neatly in the center of the hangar. Just as you finish, one of the stormtrooper patrols enters the facility. When the captain sees the stack of crates, he rushes to the wall and presses a giant red button. To his surprise, nothing happens.\n\n""I think that's our cue,"" Hera chirps in over your comms. ""Keep your heads down!""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_HAUL_PASS_2,"[i]The ceiling implodes and a Twi'lek resistance ship descends into the hangar. Soldiers rappel from the ship to help you fight off the stormtroopers. With the threat dispatched, you load the cargo and escape before more Imperials discover what's happened.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_HAUL_PASS_3,"[i]""You did well,"" Hera congratulates you. ""And we helped a lot of people tonight.""\n\nChopper grumpily warbles from behind a control panel. ""Yes,"" Hera assures him patronizingly. ""I'm sure you would made it through the gate on your own.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_HAUL_FAIL,"[i]You try to move the first batch of cargo, but tip over an entire row of shelves. It cascades into a second, then a third. As cargo loudly spills over the hangar, alarms go off. ""Yikes...Chopper's fast, but we needed a little more time than [/i]that[i],"" Hera says, shocked by your clumsiness. ""Back to the [/i]Ghost[i], on the double!"" she commands.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_29_HAUL_FAIL_2,"[i]You return to the settlement empty-handed. ""I appreciate the effort,"" Hera says, ""but it's not just the thought that counts. When we fail, people suffer."" Chopper seems to have lost all interest in you, and pesters a baby blurrg lizard as you return to your ship.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_30_1,"[i]Rebel High Command sends you vague instructions that you are to transport an important figure to their next mission. You arrive at the coordinates you were given and wait several hours before an unmarked shuttle arrives and requests permission to dock. You agree with some hesitation, and when the ships have docked, you open the airlock door to meet your new passenger.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_JR_BRIBE_PILOT,"[i]Once your ship has left Jabba's palace, you have a conversation with the pilot Jabba assigned to ferry you around. With the promise of a few extra credits, the smuggler agrees to taking a side trip or two in order to get some extra help for your next mission.\n\n""Just remember,"" the pilot warns, ""if Jabba finds out we're doing jobs on the side, we're all bantha poodoo."""
ENCOUNTER_31_NAME,"Jabba's Deal"
ENCOUNTER_31_DESC,"[i]Your rescuers take you and the other crash survivors to meet their boss, Jabba the Hutt.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_ARRIVAL_1,"[i]A rounded stronghold rises over the bluffs ahead, its metal walls battered dirty bronze. Your skiff swoops low toward the cliff face below the structure and a blast door grinds open to admit the vehicle into a tunnel beneath the palace. The cool hangar is permeated by the pungent odor of burned-out power cells and something less pleasant you can't identify.\n\nThe skiff settles to the ground and one of the Weequay grabs you to haul you off the skiff to who-knows-where.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_COMPLY,"Go with him."
ENCOUNTER_31_ARRIVAL_2C,"[i]A pale Twi'lek with jagged teeth and reddish eyes glides into the skiff hangar, flanked by bulky Gamorreans. An old human woman, skin tanned and weathered by decades of exposure to Tatooine's harsh climate, carries a jug of water to the survivors. The Twi'lek beckons you closer.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_RESIST,"Fight him off."

Several more Weequay surround you, vibro-axes at the ready.[/i]\n\nYou gained 5 fame."
ENCOUNTER_31_ARRIVAL_2R_SUCCESS,"[i]The Weequay brings up his fists to block your punch, but he's too slow, and you drop him with the impact. Another Weequay grabs you from behind, and despite your best efforts you can't break free of his hold.[/i]\n\nYou gained 3 fame."
ENCOUNTER_31_ARRIVAL_2R_FAILURE,"[i]The Weequay brings up his fists to block your punch, and your fist scuffs harmlessly off his vambrace. Another Weequay brings the haft of his vibro-ax up and jabs you in the stomach, causing you to double over.[/i]\n\nYou lost 2 fame."
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_SURRENDER,"Surrender."
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_AREYOUJABBA?,"We want to see whoever is in charge."
ENCOUNTER_31_BIB_1A,"[i]The Twi'lek sneers at you. ""I am Bib Fortuna, Jabba's majordomo,"" he introduces himself in thick, accented Basic. ""My master wishes to speak to you, as well.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_JABBA_1,"[i]Fortuna leads you to a lively audience chamber. Dozens of sets of eyes of various colors and shapes lock onto you while a live band sends mellow notes wafting through the room.\n\nThe far end of the chamber is dominated by a massive Hutt on a hoversled, the loathsome creature slackly watching your approach. ""Great Jabba,"" Fortuna says to the Hutt with a deep bow, ""I present those who fought the Imperial soldiers and delivered our new guests.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_RESPECT,"Show Jabba respect."
ENCOUNTER_31_JABBA_2R,"[i]Following Bib Fortuna's lead, you bow to Jabba and introduce yourselves. Then, the Hutt speaks in deep, sonorant Huttese. ""The Great Jabba asks what has brought you to his world,"" rasps a protocol droid, an old 3PO unit with chipped blue paint.\n\nYou describe your escape from the Empire and quest for refuge. Jabba tosses a small, squealing creature into his maw as you tell the tale.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_DEFIANCE,"Show Jabba defiance."
ENCOUNTER_31_JABBA_2D,"[i]You aren't about to just yield to some overgrown slug on a remote Outer Rim backwater. There's a moment of tense silence before Fortuna steps in and explains that you and the others with you had escaped the Empire and sought refuge. You decide not to offer up any information the majordomo doesn't already have.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_JABBA_SUCCESS,"[i]As you watch Jabba's reaction, you get the feeling that there is more than just casual animosity between Jabba the Hutt and the Empire. Jabba rumbles another proclamation, and his protocol droid provides a translation. ""The Great Jabba will consider how best you can repay your debt to him. In the meantime, you will be shown to your accommodations.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_JABBA_FAILURE,"[i]Jabba rumbles another proclamation, and his protocol droid provides a translation. ""The Great Jabba will consider how best you can repay your debt to him. In the meantime, you will be shown to your accommodations.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_TAKEUS,"Take us to our rooms."
ENCOUNTER_31_ACCOMMODATIONS,"[i]Your ""accommodations"" look more like a dungeon than guest quarters. The survivors you rescued are there, split between several cramped cells, and the old woman you saw in the skiff hangar is tending to those who have scrapes and bruises.\n\n""You will wait here for now,"" Fortuna says. ""If you are lucky, my master will have a use for you, and I will come retrieve you."" Then he disappears back up the stairs, leaving you to check on the crash survivors.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_ACCOMMODATIONS_2,"[i]You step into the first cell. {0}[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_WHATDEBT?,"Debt? What debt?"
ENCOUNTER_31_JABBA_3D,"[i]Jabba roars, smashing a hand against the blue protocol droid, who topples off the small dais. The droid props himself up to glare at you, one of his eyes flickering.\n\n""My master has offered you hospitality and mercy,"" Fortuna intervenes. ""This does not come without cost."" He grips your arm and pulls you toward the stairs.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_HELPVSEMPIRE,"We have a common enemy in the Empire."
ENCOUNTER_31_JABBA_3H,"[i]Jabba narrows his eyes before speaking. The Hutt's tone sounds more thoughtful than before, even as the protocol droid responds with the same inflection as ever. ""In that case, the Great Jabba hopes we can work toward achieving a common goal,"" the droid says carefully. Bib Fortuna grips your arm and pulls you toward the stairs.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_WAITFORBIB,"Wait for Bib Fortuna to return."
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_SURVIVORS,"Check on the survivors."
ENCOUNTER_31_RESCUEDBYHEROES,"You may now speak with the survivors you rescued from Captain Terro."
ENCOUNTER_31_RESCUEDBYJABBA,"You may now speak with the survivors Jabba's mercenaries ""rescued"" from the Empire."
ENCOUNTER_31_CHECKINGONSURVIVORS,"[i]Jabba's forces have gathered the survivors into a few cramped cells. The walls are stained from whatever the previous occupants might have experienced. Several of the survivors are sleeping off the stress of today's ordeal, but others are awake and alert and could probably use some assurance you'll get them out of this.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_SURVIVORNAME,"SurvivorName"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_SPEAKWITHSENZA,"Leave the cells."
ENCOUNTER_31_SENZA,"[i]On your way out, the old woman introduces herself as Senza. You thank her for Jabba's hospitality.\n\n""Jabba didn't ask me to do this,"" Senza says mildly. She fingers a japor snippet, a traditional Tatooine trinket of carved ivory wood. The tiny symbols on it are nearly worn away. ""I arrived here in the palace much like you did. Younger then. A lot younger."" She glances warily at the nearby Gamorrean guards and excuses herself to continue her work.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_GOBACK,"Go back."
ENCOUNTER_31_REPAYINGDEBTS_1,"[i]You wait nearly an hour for Bib Fortuna to return, and when he does he ushers you before Jabba again. ""The Great Jabba has decided to let you repay your debt through labor,"" says Jabba's protocol droid as Jabba gnaws on something that probably used to be alive. ""In his wisdom, the Great Jabba has chosen to grant you two jobs from which to choose.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_ONECONDITION,"Only if you let the survivors go."
ENCOUNTER_31_REPAYINGDEBTS_2A,"[i]Jabba lets out a ponderous, rumbling laugh before responding. ""Your bargaining posture is highly dubious,"" the droid translates. ""But when your debt is paid, the survivors are yours.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_WHATARETHEY,"What are the jobs?"
ENCOUNTER_31_REPAYINGDEBTS_2B,"[i]Bib Fortuna steps before you to explain. ""My master is sending a representative to do business with the Black Sun syndicate on Ylesia. Many credits worth of spice. But,"" he adds, holding up a crooked finger, ""Black Sun is not to be trusted or underestimated. Your presence will keep them honest or punish them for treachery.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_THEOTHER,"And the other?"
ENCOUNTER_31_REPAYINGDEBTS_3,"[i]Fortuna runs a hand along one of his head-tails. ""There is an Imperial officer who promised delivery of an exotic pet, but instead chose to keep it for himself. Retrieve the animal, eliminate the officer, and send a message to all who would betray my master: Jabba does not abide betrayal."" Fortuna's tone makes clear the message is for you as well. ""A pilot is waiting to take you to whichever job you feel best fits your skills.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_31_PLAYER_WEREONIT,"We'll do what you ask."
ENCOUNTER_31_REPAYINGDEBTS_4,"[i]As you leave Jabba's audience chamber, you hear the Hutt utter one last thick string of Huttese. The droid pipes up. ""The Great Jabba wishes to remind you that he does not accept disloyalty. And his mercy does not include second chances."" You take a moment to wonder how in over your head you are before heading up to the ship.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_32_SURVIVORS_LOSE,"[i]You return to Jabba's dungeons. A heavy pall of despair hangs in the air, and the dim lighting is good only for hiding the sullen looks on the survivors' faces.

ENCOUNTER_32_SENZA_WIN,"[i]The old woman, Senza, mops her brow with a dirty rag. ""Jabba's pleased,"" she tells you as you make your way out of one of the cells. ""He almost never treats his slaves this well. That may not be good news for you or your friends, so you know.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_PLAYER_COULDBEWORSE,"It could be worse."
ENCOUNTER_32_SENZA_CYNIC,"[i]""That's a matter of opinion,"" Senza says simply.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_PLAYER_DEALWITHJABBA,"We'll deal with Jabba."
ENCOUNTER_32_SENZA_NICETHOUGHT,"[i]""That's a nice thought,"" Senza sighs. ""But you're not the first to think you can, and some of the others have been better."" She motions up through the ceiling toward Jabba's audience chamber. ""But Jabba's still here, isn't he?""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_PLAYER_WHATABOUTYOU,"How did you end up here?"
ENCOUNTER_32_SENZA_HISTORY,"[i]""I was brought, years ago,"" Senza says. She draws her japor snippet from her tunic and rubs the ivory wood trinket between her fingers. ""I've lost count. The Clone Wars hadn't been over long."" All her energy seems to leave her. ""During the Great Drought, Jabba's thugs came to collect their water tax from my family, like they did every year then. But I refused to give them anything. We wouldn't have survived without our share of water.""\n\nShe winces, clutching the japor snippet tight to her chest. ""Jabba's men took me away and killed my husband and son."""
ENCOUNTER_32_PLAYER_WHATABOUTJABBA,"What will Jabba do with the survivors?"
ENCOUNTER_32_SENZA_JABBASPLANS,"[i]""He'll find them work, but it won't be good or honest, and they won't have a choice in it. If they're lucky, he'll never even notice they exist."" Senza shakes her head. ""I never even heard him speak my name until a few months ago.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_BIB_ARRIVES,"[i]Bib Fortuna glides into the dungeon, beckoning you to follow him. ""My master is pleased with your performance so far,"" the Twi'lek tells you. ""Now he requires another task of you. Something more befitting your obvious talents.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_SENZA_LOSE,"[i]The old woman, Senza, mops her brow with a dirty rag. ""Jabba's not happy,"" she tells you as you make your way out of one of the cells. ""He must think you're worth something or he would've already put your friends to work. Or worse."" Her shoulders sag. ""I'm the only one of my family Jabba left alive.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_PUNISHMENT,"[i]You hear a porcine bellow, and half a dozen Gamorrean guards muscle their way into the dungeon. They start snatching the food away from the survivors. ""After your failure, my master has decided you need extra motivation,"" the Twi'lek says. ""The Great Jabba needs you healthy in order to repay your debts, so you will not suffer his wrath personally. However, your friends,"" and he motions to the assembled, now-foodless survivors, ""will not eat for the next two days.""\n\nThe guards make clear that if you resist, losing their lunch will be the least of the survivors' worries.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_BEFOREJABBA,"[i]You feel the enormous Hutt's eyes on you as you enter the audience chamber. His protocol droid, slightly more battered than the last time you saw him, manages to glare at you resentfully, despite his expression being set in metal.\n\nJabba speaks. ""You failed to uphold the deal you made with the Great Jabba,"" the droid translates. ""However, the Great Jabba needs you healthy in order to repay your debts. You will not pay the price of failure this time. At least, not you personally."" The droid tilts his head with infuriating impassivity. ""Your friends will not eat for the next two days. Meal privileges may be restored if the Great Jabba concludes your performance is worth it.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_PUNISHMENTRENDERED,"[i]There are crestfallen faces all around. {0}\n\n[i]""My master is giving you one more chance,"" Fortuna beckons. ""Come with me.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_BIBS_BRIEFING_1,"[i]Fortuna leads you to a small antechamber with a holoprojector crudely installed in the middle. He summons a map of Tatooine's local space. Glowing lines trace through the air showing the paths of ships through the sector.\n\n""The Empire has established a listening post here,"" Fortuna says, stabbing at a glowing ball. ""They have caught many ships. Some of the most talented smugglers in my master's employ have been forced to dump their cargo...much to Jabba's displeasure.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_PLAYER_BLOWIT,"So you want us to blow it up?"
ENCOUNTER_32_BIBS_BRIEFING_2,"[i]The Twi'lek shakes his head. ""The Empire would only build a new listening post, more heavily guarded. No...this is a chance to turn their equipment to my master's advantage.""\n\nHe swipes through the air, and the map is replaced with an image of a deep depression in the desert. ""We have arranged a trap for Captain Terro. One of the captain's patrols has 'gone missing,' and word has gotten back to him that they disappeared here, at the Great Pit of Carkoon. You must go there, ambush the Imperials, and acquire the code cylinders they carry. Those will get us access to the listening post's systems. And then my master may hear what the Empire hears.""\n\nPerhaps seeing a flicker of defiance in your eyes, Fortuna holds up a knobby finger. ""Refuse, and my master's patience with your friends will run out very quickly.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_32_PLAYER_ONOURWAY,"We're already leaving."
ENCOUNTER_33_NAME,"Jabba's Ambition"
ENCOUNTER_33_DESC,"[i]You return to the palace in hopes of finally paying off your debt to Jabba.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_THEHUTTSMILES_1,"[i]Bib Fortuna takes the code cylinders from you and presents them to Jabba, bowing as he unfurls his long fingers. The Hutt smiles wide, like he's about to attempt to just swallow his majordomo whole.\n\n""The Great Jabba is very pleased with your success,"" Jabba's protocol droid says when Jabba speaks. ""Now all that remains is to penetrate Captain Terro's listening post and turn it to serve the Great Jabba.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_THEHUTTFROWNS_1,"[i]Bib Fortuna takes the code cylinders and presents them to Jabba, bowing as he unfurls his long fingers. The bounty hunter who retrieved them when you failed to do so glances smugly in your direction. The Hutt frowns deeply at having to spend credits on the bounty hunter.\n\n""The Great Jabba is gravely disappointed,"" Jabba's protocol droid says when Jabba speaks. ""But the task is done nonetheless. Now all that remains is to penetrate Captain Terro's listening post and turn it to serve the Great Jabba.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_US?,"And you want us to do it?"
ENCOUNTER_33_THEHUTTSMILES_2,"[i]""Precisely. If you still wish for your friends to survive."" Jabba speaks again, his words twisting into a low, rumbling chuckle. ""Further,"" continues the droid, ""this creates an opportunity to deal decisively with the Imperial presence on Tatooine."" The droid's eyes flash. ""You must eliminate Captain Terro himself.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_THEHUTTFROWNS_2,"[i]""You have no choice. You are fortunate that the Great Jabba has chosen to show your friends mercy after your failure."" Jabba speaks again, his words twisting into a low, threatening chuckle. ""Further,"" continues the droid, ""this creates an opportunity to deal decisively with the Imperial presence on Tatooine."" The droid's eyes flash. ""You must eliminate Captain Terro himself.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_ACCEPTANCE,"We want another shot at him, too."
ENCOUNTER_33_THEHUTTSMILES_3A,"[i]The Hutt guffaws, and tosses a celebratory snack into his mouth, chewing as he speaks. ""The Great Jabba is glad that you finally see reason,"" the droid translates.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_THEHUTTFROWNS_3A,"[i]The Hutt frowns even deeper at that, and Fortuna slides just a little farther away from his master. ""The Great Jabba is glad that you finally understand your place,"" the droid translates.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_REJECTION,"We aren't assassins."
ENCOUNTER_33_THEHUTTSMILES_3R,"[i]""You will be,"" croaks Fortuna. ""Or the bargain for your friends' safety is off.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_KHETANNA_DAMAGE,"[i]Jabba starts to gnaw on some sort of large drumstick. A Nikto wearing a mechanic's vest slinks into the audience chamber and whispers something to Jabba. The Hutt's lips turn down a bit, then he starts to cackle and mumbles around his delicious meal. ""The Great Jabba is amused by your tactics of using the deck gun of the [/i]Khetanna[i] to fire upon the deck itself,"" his droid says. ""Never do that again.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_KHETANNA_HEAVY_DAMAGE,"[i]Jabba starts to gnaw on some sort of large drumstick. A Nikto wearing a mechanic's vest slinks into the audience chamber and whispers something to Jabba. You hear his protocol droid say, ""Oh, not again,"" just before Jabba flies into a rage, swinging the massive drumstick in all directions. The Nikto ducks out of the way, but the droid isn't so lucky, and he goes flying to the ground from the impact, limbs breaking against the floor.\n\nFortuna shrugs. ""It seems you did significant damage to the [/i]Khetanna[i] with the deck gun,"" he explains.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_KHETANNA_IMPOUNDED,"[i]Jabba starts to gnaw on some sort of large drumstick. A Nikto wearing a mechanic's vest slinks into the audience chamber and whispers something to Fortuna. The Twi'lek frowns and turns to Jabba. ""Master, Captain Terro has impounded the [/i]Khetanna[i].""\n\nJabba's eyes widen, and there is a brief moment of calm before the Hutt flies into a rage, swinging the massive drumstick in all directions. He strikes his protocol droid, and the droid goes flying to the ground from the impact, limbs breaking against the floor. Jabba continues to pound the droid with the slab of meat, venting his fury in a haze of nuts, bolts, and chunks of barbecued womp rat.\n\nFortuna bows placatingly. ""I will arrange for the appropriate bribes to be paid,"" he assures Jabba.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_REASSURANCE_1,"[i]Fortuna clears his throat before continuing. ""Captain Terro may increase security at the listening post if we give him a chance to do so,"" Fortuna explains, ""so you will have to leave immediately. I will have one of Jabba's most lethal agents accompany you.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_SURVIVORS?,"We want to know our friends are safe."
ENCOUNTER_33_REASSURANCE_2,"[i]Fortuna's lips curl viciously. ""You should remain focused on the task at hand. But if you must have some guarantee..."" He glances at Jabba slyly. Jabba stares back at him, chewing thoughtfully. ""I will summon Senza for you."" Fortuna lets you turn to go before adding, ""Did she ever mention her family name? It's Terro. The Imperial captain is her son.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_FAMILYDEAD,"She said her family was dead."
ENCOUNTER_33_REASSURANCE_3,"[i]""That's certainly what she believes,"" Fortuna says simply. He waves you off, hurrying you along to do Jabba's dirty work.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_SENZA_1,"[i]Sure enough, Senza meets you in the docking bay. ""Your friends are still alright,"" she confirms. ""You may not have cause to believe me, but I swear to you its true.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_SENZATRUTH,"Tell Senza about Captain Terro."
ENCOUNTER_33_SENZA_2T,"[i]Senza's lip quivers. She blinks a few times and clutches her japor charm as tight as she can manage. Then the tears start to flow.\n\n""I can't find the hope to believe it, but I don't know why you would lie to me,"" she stammers, wiping her eyes. ""My son, alive. Tell me...is he a good man?""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_HONORABLE,"He is a man of honor."
ENCOUNTER_33_SENZA_3H,"[i]""I can tell you aren't saying everything,"" she sighs. ""But ever meeting him is as much of a fantasy as his survival was. I just wanted to know that some part of the boy I knew is still alive in him, and it sounds like he is.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_SOLDIER,"He is a great leader."
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_NOPE,"No, he's pretty bad."
ENCOUNTER_33_SENZA_3N,"[i]Senza looks crestfallen, the wind leaving her sails once and for all. ""I can't say that is surprising,"" she mutters, her voice small. ""The galaxy does not leave much room for good men...Tatooine least of all."" She looks up at you again. ""Thank you for telling me, all the same.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_SENZASON,"Ask Senza if she has a son."
ENCOUNTER_33_SENZA_2S,"[i]""I had a son. He was very young when Jabba's thugs attacked our farm."" She strokes her japor charm and sniffs. ""They took my husband and son away and killed them. I should've done what had to be done."""
ENCOUNTER_33_PLAYER_SENZAOMISSION,"Thank her and go."
ENCOUNTER_33_DEPARTURETRUTH,"[i]""Good luck,"" says Senza. ""May the Force be with you.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_33_DEPARTUREOMISSION,"[i]""Good luck,"" says Senza. ""I understand the man who leads the Imperials here is dangerous. When you meet him, think of your friends here and do what must be done.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_NAME,"Safe Haven"
ENCOUNTER_34_DESC,"[i]The Rebel rescue ship takes you to a secret hideout to plan your next move.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_SAFEHAVEN_1,"[i]You reach the Rebel hideout in a remote system. You set down in the docking bay and are welcomed by a line of Alliance rangers with blasters at the ready.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_HANDS,"Hold up your hands."
ENCOUNTER_34_SAFEHAVEN_2H,"[i]You raise your hands slowly. A few rangers rush forward to check you for weapons or any devices that might label you as Imperial spies. Satisfied, one of them gives their commander a nod. She steps forward. ""I'm sorry for the cold reception. The Empire has been nipping at our heels for weeks,"" she explains. ""I'm Lieutenant Adromie, commander of this outpost. I understand from our people on Tatooine that you have some code cylinders for us?""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_HANDOFF,"Hand them over."
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_TOSS,"Toss the code cylinders on the deck."
ENCOUNTER_34_SAFEHAVEN_2T,"[i]The rangers tense, but notice what you've thrown are not grenades, but code cylinders. Their commander steps forward and bends to pick them up. ""Well, we're off to a great start,"" she mutters. A few of her rangers pat you down for any signs of listening devices. ""I'm Lieutenant Adromie, commander of this outpost. I'm sorry for the cold reception. The Empire has been nipping at our heels for weeks."""
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_NOTALONE,"You aren't the only ones."
ENCOUNTER_34_SAFEHAVEN_3,"[i]Adromie holds up the code cylinders. ""These will help more than you know. How can we repay you?""\n\nYou explain what you've been through on Tatooine and how Jabba the Hutt is still holding many of your friends captive. ""I think we can help with that,"" Adromie says thoughtfully. ""Let me make a call.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_RESCUED_1,"[i]You spend the subsequent hours resting at the Rebel hideout. The conditions in the hideout aren't ideal, but they're better than at Jabba's palace. The Rebels don't have a lot to go around, but they are more generous with what they have than the Hutt was.\n\nThe next day, Lieutenant Adromie summons you to the docking bay. ""Our team from Tatooine is arriving,"" she explains.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_TOBAY,"Go to the docking bay."
ENCOUNTER_34_RESCUED_2,"[i]A short-range transport lands in the docking bay just as you enter. The hatch opens and a ragtag group of Rebels emerge, clothes coated in Tatooine sand.\n\nThen, you see {0}'s head poke out of the hatch tentatively.\n\nOne by one, the survivors of the crash step onto the deck, blinking at the lighting after their stay in Jabba's dim dungeons.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_GREET,"Greet them warmly."
ENCOUNTER_34_RESCUED_3,"[i]Your friends are glad to see you, and thank you for securing a way out of Jabba's clutches. You meet their rescuers, too, a band of Rebel agents who tell you of their own wild adventures on Tatooine and elsewhere. A sandy-haired Rebel in dark clothing is talking to {0}. A group of Alliance rangers offers food to {1} and {2}, who eagerly accept. A medic examines {3} for lingering injuries from the crash.\n\nThough the threat of the Empire continues to loom, Lieutenant Adromie assures you the Rebel transport [/i]Freedom Fighter[i] is on its way to carry you to somewhere secure.\n\nAnd yet...something is nagging at you. That rescue seemed too easy.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Enter the total ."
ENCOUNTER_34_NOTICE_FAILURE,"[i]You take a closer look at the Rebel team's transport. It's clearly seen better days, even under Tatooine's twin suns. You notice a faint glow beneath one of the maneuvering vanes. Taking a closer look, you dust off a strange device that seems foreign to the ship, but that you can't identify. You call Lieutenant Adromie over and point it out to her.\n\n""An Imperial tracking device!"" she exclaims when she sees it. ""If the Empire knows the location of this base, we're all in danger. It must be transmitting to Captain Terro's listening post on Tatooine.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_NOTICE_SUCCESS,"[i]You take a closer look at the Rebel team's transport. It's clearly seen better days, even under Tatooine's twin suns. You notice a faint glow beneath one of the maneuvering vanes. Taking a closer look, you dust off a tracking device of Imperial design.\n\n""Good thing you found this,"" Lieutenant Adromie says when you notify her of your discovery. ""If the Empire knows the location of this base, we're all in danger. It must be transmitting to Captain Terro's listening post on Tatooine.""[/i]\n\nYou gained 5 fame."
ENCOUNTER_34_NOTICE_GREATSUCCESS,"[i]You take a closer look at the Rebel team's transport. It's clearly seen better days, even under Tatooine's twin suns. You notice a faint glow beneath one of the maneuvering vanes. Taking a closer look, you dust off a tracking device cobbled together from parts of several Imperial designs, welded crudely to the underside of the hull.\n\n""Good thing you found this,"" Lieutenant Adromie says when you notify her of your discovery. ""If the Empire knows the location of this base, we're all in danger. It must be transmitting to Captain Terro's listening post on Tatooine."" You can't help but wonder why Terro would use such a makeshift tracking device.[/i]\n\nYou gained 8 fame."
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_BLOWITUP,"We must attack the listening post."
ENCOUNTER_34_YOURMISSION,"[i]Adromie nods. ""I have to agree. If we can destroy the information before the Empire gets a chance to analyze it, we can stay hidden. Not going to be easy, though."" She crosses her arms over her uniform jacket. ""You can have your pick of our soldiers as an escort, but we will need some of them to help defend the hideout in your absence.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_34_PLAYER_COUNTUSIN,"Count us in."
ENCOUNTER_34_ALLIES,"You receive regular Rebel Troopers, regular Rebel Saboteurs, regular Alliance Rangers, and Luke Skywalker (Jedi Knight) as allies for the next mission!"
ENCOUNTER_35_NAME,"Enemy of My Enemy"
ENCOUNTER_35_DESC,"[i]With the help of Captain Terro, you reunite with the lost survivors while you decide how to rescue those still held by Jabba the Hutt.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_35_CALL_TERRO,"[i]You contact Captain Terro using his secure channel. Honor-bound, he respects the deal that paid for his life.\n\nYou receive coordinates to a remote outpost and set out to reunite with the lost survivors.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_IMPERIAL_BASE,"[i]You arrive at the dewback stables, where Captain Terro escorts you to an impressive series of tents on the outskirts of the camp.\n\n""You are not the first to flee Jabba's grasp,"" Terro says as he guides you through the crowded refugee camp. ""Without authorization for a proper offensive, the best I can do is shelter his victims.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_MEET_0,"[i]Terro stops at a small tent and lifts back the entrance flaps. Inside you find a handful of faces that you recognize from the transport, but who disappeared from the crash before you returned.\n\nTerro leaves and you spend hours catching up with the other crash survivors.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_MEET_1,"[i]Terro stops at a small tent and lifts back the entrance flaps. Inside you find {0} {1}, whom you hadn't seen since Terro initially captured the survivor.\n\nTerro leaves and you spend hours catching up.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_MEET_2,"[i]Terro stops at a small tent and lifts back the entrance flaps. Inside you find {0} {1} and {2} {3} whom you hadn't seen since Terro initially captured the survivors.\n\nTerro leaves and you spend hours catching up.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_MEET_3,"[i]Terro stops at a small tent and lifts back the entrance flaps. Inside you find {0} {1}, {2} {3}, and a handful of faces that you recognize from the transport whom you hadn't seen since Terro initially captured the survivors.\n\nTerro leaves and you spend hours catching up.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_35_TERRO_1,"[i]Having learned from the survivors that Terro has treated them well and even fought off mercenary raids, you return to the captain to thank him.\n\n""I joined the Empire to fight back against criminals like Jabba,"" Terro explains. ""He took my family from me, and joining the Empire was my only way to stop him from doing the same to others. Only recently did I learn that my mother is still alive, taken as a slave by Jabba when I was a child.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_TERRO_2,"[i]You chat for a minute about how meaningless the war seems from here, before Terro reminds you of your purpose.\n\n""The way I see it, you only have two options for freeing your friends from Jabba,"" he offers. ""You can offer your lives for theirs, or you can assault the palace.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_OPTION_1,"Discuss the deal."
ENCOUNTER_35_OPTION_2,"Discuss the assault."
ENCOUNTER_35_DISCUSS_DEAL,"[i]""Not many people are as dangerous to Jabba as you are,"" Terro observes. ""Most that are end up in his employ. If you are willing to do whatever it takes to guarantee your friends' safety, Jabba would likely accept an exchange.""\n\n""If you secure my mother's freedom as part of that deal,"" Terro stipulates, ""I will oversee the exchange. I promise on my honor and life that everyone will be safe. After that, I'll have my spies in the palace do what they can to help you stage an escape.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_DISCUSS_ASSAULT,"[i]""My forces have considered a direct assault many times,"" Terro explains. ""If we strike hard enough, we could theoretically breach the palace and fight our way to the prisoners. This path is riskier; there's no guarantee everyone will make it out alive. But if you're set on it, I'll fight with you until we can get to my mother and your friends.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_CHOOSE_MISSION,"[i]""Have you decided how you want to proceed?"" Terro asks.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_CHOOSE_DEAL,"Let's make the deal."
ENCOUNTER_35_CHOOSE_ASSAULT,"Let's take the fight to Jabba."
ENCOUNTER_35_CONFIRM_DEAL,"Are you ready to offer your lives for the survivors?"
ENCOUNTER_35_CONFIRM_ASSAULT,"Are you ready to attack Jabba's palace?"

ENCOUNTER_35_SEND_TERMS,"[i]""Then it's settled,"" Terro says with a nod. ""Send Jabba the terms.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_JABBA_ACCEPTS,"[i]After a few nerve-racking hours you receive coordinates and a simple reply from Bib Fortuna: ""Offer accepted.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_35_TERRO_EXCHANGE,"[i]Terro flies you to the coordinates along a sandy road, where his squad of stormtroopers squares off a hundred paces from Bib Fortuna and his gang of Weequay.\n\nSlowly, Terro marches you up the right side of the road while {0}, {1}, Senza, and the others are released silently to stormtroopers on the other side.\n\nYou see the survivors escorted to safety as Weequay bind your hands and throw sacks over your heads.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_35_TERRO_STORM_PALACE,"[i]Terro suggests you wait until nightfall to assault the palace, which should give you the element of surprise. You are concerned about Jabba retaliating against his captives before you can reach them, but launching an assault in broad daylight seems like suicide.\n\nYou agree to Terro's plan, and spend the rest of the afternoon catching up with the survivors in Terro's camp.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_36_NAME,"The Rebel Way"
ENCOUNTER_36_DESC,"[i]Having bested Jabba's assassins, you return to your Rebel allies to discuss how to finally free the survivors still held by the vile Hutt.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_36_JOIN_REBELS,"[i]You rejoin your Rebel allies to discuss how to proceed.\n\n""Jabba just played his hand,"" the saboteur commander advises. ""We need to strike while he's weak!""\n\n""Yes, but we risk the survivors' safety if we attack the Hutt in his own palace,"" Lieutenant Adromie counters. ""We should use our victory as bargaining leverage.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_36_OPTION_1,"Discuss the deal."
ENCOUNTER_36_OPTION_2,"Discuss the assault."
ENCOUNTER_36_DISCUSS_DEAL,"[i]""You survived a premeditated ambush by Jabba's best assassins,"" Adromie observes. ""If you are willing to do whatever it takes to guarantee your friends' safety, Jabba would likely accept an exchange: your lives for theirs.""\n\n""If you decide to offer this trade,"" the lieutenant continues, ""I'll have my soldiers escort you to the exchange. You have my word that the survivors will be safe, but I can't guarantee the same for you.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_36_DISCUSS_ASSAULT,"[i]""Jabba threw his best at you and it wasn't enough,"" the saboteur explains. ""If you strike soon and hard, you could breach the palace and fight your way to the prisoners.""\n\n""This path is riskier,"" the commander admits. ""There's no guarantee everyone will make it out alive.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_36_CHOOSE_MISSION,"[i]After lively debate, the Rebels defer the final choice to you.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_36_CHOOSE_DEAL,"Let's make the deal."
ENCOUNTER_36_CHOOSE_ASSAULT,"Let's take the fight to Jabba."
ENCOUNTER_36_CONFIRM_DEAL,"Are you ready to offer your lives for the survivors?"
ENCOUNTER_36_CONFIRM_ASSAULT,"Are you ready to attack Jabba's palace?"

ENCOUNTER_36_SEND_TERMS,"[i]""Then it's settled,"" the ranger says as her soldiers prepare for the exchange. ""Send Jabba the terms.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_36_JABBA_ACCEPTS,"[i]After a few nerve-racking hours you receive coordinates and a simple reply from Bib Fortuna: ""Offer accepted.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_36_RANGER_EXCHANGE,"[i]You fly to the coordinates along a sandy road, where the rangers take overwatch positions a hundred paces from Bib Fortuna and his gang of Weequay.\n\nSlowly, Lieutenant Adromie marches you up the right side of the road while {0}, {1}, and the others are released on the opposite side.\n\nYou see the survivors escorted to safety as Weequay bind your hands and throw sacks over your heads.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_36_STORM_PALACE,"[i]The saboteur suggests you wait until nightfall to assault the palace, which should give you the element of surprise. You are concerned about Jabba retaliating against his captives before you can reach them, but launching an assault in broad daylight seems like suicide.\n\nYou agree to the plan, and spend the rest of the afternoon resting up and preparing for the fight of your lives.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_37_NAME,"All Alone"
ENCOUNTER_37_DESC,"[i]Betrayed by Jabba, wanted by the Empire, and still cut off from the Rebellion, you retreat to determine how to finally free the survivors still held by the vile Hutt.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_37_JOIN_REBELS,"[i]With no allies left, you consider the options on the table. You ultimately settle on two possible plans of action.\n\nYou could offer to exchange your lives for the survivors', or you could attempt an assault on the palace itself.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_37_OPTION_1,"Consider the deal."
ENCOUNTER_37_OPTION_2,"Consider the assault."
ENCOUNTER_37_DISCUSS_DEAL,"[i]Jabba put prices on your heads, so he clearly wants you dealt with. His hired hunter already failed, and others will be reluctant to try. Jabba might be willing to make a prisoner exchange.\n\nIf the Hutt accepts the deal, you could guarantee the survivors are free before giving yourselves up.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_37_DISCUSS_ASSAULT,"[i]Jabba's forces have proven no match for you. If you attack while he's still reeling from his failed betrayal, you could penetrate the palace and stage a breakout.\n\nIf you take too long, however, there's no guarantee that the survivors will be safe.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_37_CHOOSE_MISSION,"[i]The decision weighs heavily on you.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_37_CHOOSE_DEAL,"Let's make the deal."
ENCOUNTER_37_CHOOSE_ASSAULT,"Let's take the fight to Jabba."
ENCOUNTER_37_CONFIRM_DEAL,"Are you ready to offer your lives for the survivors?"
ENCOUNTER_37_CONFIRM_ASSAULT,"Are you ready to attack Jabba's palace?"

ENCOUNTER_37_SEND_TERMS,"[i]You agree to turn yourselves in and send Jabba the terms of your surrender.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_37_JABBA_ACCEPTS,"[i]After a few nerve-racking hours you receive coordinates and a simple reply from Bib Fortuna: ""Offer accepted.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_37_EXCHANGE,"[i]You fly to the coordinates along a sandy road, and march toward Bib Fortuna and his gang of Weequay.\n\nYou place your weapons on the ground as instructed. {0}, {1}, and the others are released on the opposite side of the road. You let the pirates take you into custody, but then Bib gives the order to open fire on the survivors.\n\nYou struggle against your captors as the survivors flee toward your ship, but Weequay bind your hands and throw sacks over your heads.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_37_STORM_PALACE,"[i]You consider waiting until nightfall to assault the palace, which should give you the element of surprise. You are concerned about Jabba retaliating against his captives before you can reach them, but launching an assault in broad daylight seems like suicide.\n\nYou decide waiting will give you your best chance for success, and spend the rest of the afternoon resting up and preparing for the fight of your lives.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_38_NAME,"In Enemy Hands"
ENCOUNTER_38_DESC,"[i]Having failed in your mission to defeat Captain Terro, you find yourselves imprisoned by the Empire. All you can do is wait to learn what fate Terro will choose for you.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_38_TERRO,"[i]The door to your cell at the Imperial holding facility in Mos Eisley opens. Squinting through the sudden flood of bright light into the dim cell, you make out the shape of a stormtrooper with an orange captain's pauldron as he enters. Standing just outside the door is a squad of armed stormtroopers, weapons at the ready.\n\n""You have been no end of trouble for me,"" a voice you recognize as Terro's says through the captain's helmet, ""but having you alive has presented an unexpected opportunity.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_38_TERRO_2,"[i]""Jabba the Hutt has long plagued this planet with his criminal activities,"" Terro explains. ""Among his litany of crimes are kidnapping and murder, both of which affect me personally. You see, back when I was a young boy growing up here on Tatooine, Jabba's thugs murdered both of my parents... or so I thought. I have only recently learned that my mother is still alive, living in forced servitude to the Hutt. Fortunately, I now have a chip with which to bargain for her freedom: you.""\n\n""Jabba has agreed to exchange you for my mother, along with several others who had been taken captive from a civilian craft that recently crash landed not far from here.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_38_TERRO_2_BTN,"What will happen to the crash survivors?"
ENCOUNTER_38_TERRO_3,"[i]""They will receive food and medical treatment, and then they will rejoin the rest of the survivors of the crash as my guests,"" Terro replies. ""They have committed no crime, and are free to leave any time they choose.\n\n""As for you, I am sure a terrible fate awaits you at Jabba's hands,"" Terro continues, ""and while I would not be sad to see you die for your own crimes against the Empire, I would rather see an end to Jabba's reign.\n\n""I have certain... friends inside Jabba's palace, and I have instructed them to provide you a means by which to bring down the Hutt. Whether you succeed and destroy Jabba or fail and perish yourselves makes little difference to me. But if you attempt to thwart this prisoner exchange, I will not hesitate to kill you.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_38_TERRO_3_BTN,"Understood."
ENCOUNTER_38_EXCHANGE,"[i]The stormtroopers put you in stun cuffs and load you onto a speeder, which travels deep into the Dune Sea. It comes to a stop on a flat, rocky area with firm footing and nowhere to hide forces for an ambush: the perfect spot for an exchange.\n\nAs you are unloaded from the speeder, you see the survivors, along with Jabba's servant Senza, standing in a group near two skiffs. A dozen armed Weequay flank the prisoners on all sides.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_38_EXCHANGE_2,"[i]Terro orders you to start walking, and as you do, Senza and the survivors are released to start walking toward you. The survivors give you looks ranging from gratitude to anguish as they pass by you on their way toward Terro's men.\n\nWhen you reach the Weequay, they grab each of you and force you onto your knees. You wonder briefly if Jabba has come to his senses and ordered you to be executed immediately, but the Weequay slip cloth sacks over your heads and roughly load you onto the skiffs for transport. One way or another, this will be your last journey into Jabba's realm.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_NAME,"In the Trenches"
ENCOUNTER_41_DESC,"[i]Having survived your encounter with the peculiar Imperial tank, you know it is just a matter of time before the Empire sends more troops to hunt you down. With your supplies running dangerously low, you will need to take extreme measures to get off world.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_41_2S_INTRO,"[i]After putting some distance between yourselves and the remains of the Imperial patrol, you settle in with your fellow troopers in one of the trenches to catch your breath. As you search the area for supplies, Talcon and Kish begin talking about their experience during the Empire’s attack.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_INTRO,"[i]After putting some distance between yourselves and the remains of the Imperial patrol, you and Lieutenant Talcon settle into one of the trenches to catch your breath. As you search the area for supplies, Talcon begins talking about her experience during the Empire’s attack.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_BATTLE,"Where were you during the battle?"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_BATTLE_RESPONSE,"[i]Lieutenant Talcon stares out across the frozen battlefield, a grim look on her face. “When the first walkers crossed the ridge, we were at the front line.” Her gaze returns to the present. “And when command called for the final evacuation, we stayed behind to cover the retreat.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_UNIT,"Did the rest of your unit make it out?"
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_UNIT_RESPONSE,"[i]Talcon goes silent and Corporal Kish responds. “We are all that is left of our unit. When the shield generator blew, we held our ground as long as we could, but the battle quickly descended into chaos.” He adjusts the sights on his A280 blaster rifle. “How about your unit?”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_UNIT_RESPONSE,"[i]She slowly shakes her head. “With Kish gone, I am the only survivor. He was a good soldier. And a good friend. I should be the one to tell his family on Corellia.” Talcon absently adjusts the sights on her A280 blaster rifle. “How about your squad?”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_UNIT_SILENT,"Remain silent."
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_UNIT_TALK,"Tell her about your commander’s sacrifice."
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_SILENT_RESPONSE,"[i]Kish nods in quiet understanding. After a few moments of silence, Talcon breaks the silence. “Let’s not let the sacrifice of our fallen comrades be in vain. We can honor their memory by getting the information about this new tank back to Rebel High Command.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_SILENT_RESPONSE,"[i]Talcon nods in quiet understanding. After a few moments of silence, she stands. “Let’s not let the sacrifice of our fallen comrades be in vain,” Talcon says. “We can honor their memory by getting the information about this new tank back to Rebel High Command.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_TALK_RESPONSE,"[i]Kish nods in understanding. “I didn’t know your commander personally, but he sounds like he was a good man.”\n\nTalcon stands to address the group. ""We won't let his sacrifice be in vain. We can honor his memory by getting the information about this new tank back to Rebel High Command.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_TALK_RESPONSE,"[i]Talcon nods in understanding. “I didn’t know your commander personally. It sounds like he was a good man.” She stands. ”We won't let his sacrifice be in vain. We can honor his memory by getting the information about this new tank back to Rebel High Command.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_PLAN,"What's the plan?"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAN_RESPONSE,"[i]""First, we find a ship."" She pulls out a datapad. “Then, without coordinates to the rendezvous point, we are going to need to find safe haven while we attempt to make contact with the Alliance.” She brings up a sector map and points to a planet. “We head here. Ison. I have an old friend there.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_SOLID,"Anywhere's better than here."
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_TRUST,"How well do you trust this “friend”?"
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_SOLID_RESPONSE_TEST,"[i]“We can grab a hot meal and figure out how to get back to the Alliance."" Kish suddenly tenses, raising a tight fist to cut off the conversation. The pulsing whir of an approaching droid carries through the cold air. You scramble to find cover.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_SOLID_RESPONSE_TEST,"[i]“We can grab a hot meal and figure out how to get back to the Alliance."" Talcon suddenly tenses and goes silent. The pulsing whir of an approaching droid carries through the cold air. You scramble to find cover.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_TRUST_RESPONSE_TEST,"[i]“With my life. We can get a hot meal while we figure out how to get back to the Alliance.” Kish cuts her off with a quick hand motion as the pulsing whir of an approaching droid carries through the cold air. You scramble to find cover.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_TRUST_RESPONSE_TEST,"[i]“With my life. We can get a hot meal while we figure out how to get back to the Alliance.” She trails off as the pulsing whir of an approaching droid carries through the cold air. You scramble to find cover.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PATROL_SUCCESS,"[i]A floating probe droid approaches the crashed snowspeeder you found cover in. It pauses for several heartbeats, scanning the surrounding area. Unable to see you among the debris, it moves on. As you come out of your hiding spot, you discover a medpac in the speeder's cockpit.[/i]\n\nYou gained 1 medpac for your next mission."
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_PATROL_FAIL,"[i]A floating probe droid scans the area, and detects you hiding in the debris. It turns its blaster toward you just as Talcon and Kish fire from their hiding spot along the trench. The droid goes up in a ball of flame, but you have to assume your location is now known to the Imperials.[/i]"

It turns its blaster toward you just as Talcon fires from her hiding spot along the trench. The droid goes up in a ball of flame, but you have to assume your location is now known to the Imperials.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_MOVING_RESPONSE,"[i]Corporal Kish looks back toward the base. “We need to get our hands on a ship ASAP. And walking in the front door is not really an option L.T.”\n\nTalcon nods in agreement, then offers a solution. “We can get in through the tunnels.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_MOVING_RESPONSE,"[i]Lieutenant Talcon scans the area for more patrols. “We need to get our hands on a ship ASAP, but walking in the front door isn’t really an option.” She brings up another screen on her datapad. “There are some tunnels nearby that should lead into the base.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_TUNNELS,"Tunnels?"
ENCOUNTER_41_2S_TUNNELS_RESPONSE,"[i]Kish turns pale. “You mean the tunnels that we sealed off because they were infested with carnivorous snow beasts? No way! I’ll take my chances with the Imperials before I go back down there!”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_TUNNELS_RESPONSE,"[i]“We discovered them when we first arrived to set up the base. There are rumors of snow beasts that wander them, but I imagine they are exaggerated.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_BEASTS,"Wait, snow beasts?"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_BEASTS_RESPONSE,"[i]Talcon waves the question away. “Listen, we can’t stay here. We are running dangerously low on rations and the longer we stay out in this cold the worse chance we have of getting off this rock. A head-on assault on the base is suicide. Snow beasts or no, the tunnels are our best bet.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_1S_PLAYER_FINISH,"Let’s get moving then!"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_INTRO,"[i]Your first priority is to find a ship in order to escape the planet. With the constant Imperial presence, you know that a frontal assault would be suicide. Consulting your datapad, you bring up a topographic map of the surrounding area in order to look for an alternative entrance. You also have the datachip you received from Lieutenant Talcon.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_PLAYER_OPTION_MAP,"Search for an entrance."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_PLAYER_OPTION_DATA,"Consult Talcon's datachip."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_MAP,"[i]The map shows a series of caves that connect from the surrounding mountains and appear to also lead under Echo Base. You remember hearing rumors when you first arrived of carnivorous snow beasts wandering those tunnels, but you don’t have time to worry about that right now.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_DATA,"[i]Looking at the information the lieutenant gave you before she died, you see that she marked the sector map with information for the Ison system, and a planet there of the same name. She also references a mountain village called “Haven” and someone named “Benex” as a point of contact.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_ROUTES,"[i]Satisfied with the information you have, you focus on getting into Echo Base and off the planet. There are two routes you can take on your way to the tunnels: the direct route across the trenches and former battlefield, or a longer route into the surrounding mountains that is likely less well watched.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_DATAPAD,"Put away the datapad."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_PLAYER_BATTLEFIELD,"Head across the battlefield."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_PLAYER_MOUNTAINS,"Head into the mountains."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_BF_PATROL_TEST,"[i]After traveling for some time through the debris of the battlefield, you settle into one of the trenches to catch your breath. Suddenly, the pulsing whir of an approaching droid carries through the cold air. You scramble to find cover.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_BF_PATROL_SUCCESS,"[i]A floating probe droid approaches the crashed snowspeeder you found cover in. It pauses for several heartbeats, scanning the surrounding area. Unable to see you among the debris, it moves on. As you come out of your hiding spot, you discover a medpac in the speeder's cockpit.[/i]\n\nYou gained 1 medpac for your next mission."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_BF_PATROL_FAIL,"[i]A floating probe droid scans the area, and detects you hiding in the debris. It turns its blaster toward you, but you get the draw on it. The droid goes up in a ball of flame, but you have to assume your location is now known to the Imperials.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_MTNS_SURVIVAL_TEST,"[i]The trek into the mountains is taxing. The snow gets deeper the farther up you go and the wind bites at your exposed skin.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_MTNS_SURVIVAL_SUCCESS,"[i]Although the hike is slow and difficult, you find yourself making progress toward the tunnel entrance. About halfway through your journey, a downed snowspeeder lies half-buried in the snow. A quick search yields some damaged gear and repair parts. After some time, you see the entrance ahead.[/i]\n\nYou gained 25 credits!"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_MTNS_SURVIVAL_FAIL,"[i]You realize quickly that you are not prepared for the difficult weather. Picking up your pace, you head back down into the trenches. You determine it will be safer than trying to find the tunnel entrance in the adverse conditions of the mountains.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_END,"[i]You continue through the trenches until you see a cave opening up ahead. While keeping low and out of sight, you quietly make your way toward your destination.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_41_0S_PLAYER_FINISH,"Head toward the tunnel system."
ENCOUNTER_42_NAME,"It Takes a Village"
ENCOUNTER_42_DESC,"[i]Having escaped Hoth in an Imperial shuttle, you head to a small mountain village on the planet Ison where you hope to find temporary refuge until you can rejoin the Rebel fleet.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_42_2S_INTRO,"[i]You drop out of hyperspace and head toward the planet. With Kish piloting, Talcon directs him to the coordinates for Haven, then turns to you.\n\n“Benex and I grew up together,” she says. “When our city was razed by the Empire, I left to join the Alliance. Benex wanted to get away from the fighting.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_INTRO,"[i]You drop out of hyperspace and head toward the planet. After reaching the atmosphere, Talcon directs you to the coordinates for Haven.\n\n“Benex and I grew up together,” she says. “When our city was razed by the Empire, I left to join the Alliance. Benex wanted to get away from the fighting.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_INTRO,"[i]You drop out of hyperspace and head toward the planet. You follow the directions provided by Lieutenant Talcon before her death and locate the small village tucked in a valley near a large mountain.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_PLAYER_COWARD,"She sounds like a coward."
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_PLAYER_WAR,"War is not for everyone."
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_RESPONSE_COWARD,"[i]Talcon turns red with anger. “Benex is no coward. She lost everything when the Empire came to our planet. She has devoted her life to carving out a peaceful existence and helping others do the same.” She stares at you defiantly.\n\n“I fight so people like Benex don’t have to.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_PLAYER_SORRY,"Sorry, you’re right."
ENCOUNTER_42_2S_RESPONSE_WAR,"[i]Talcon nods appreciatively. “Exactly,"" she says. ""I fight so that people like Benex don’t have to.”\n\nKish mutters to himself in the back as he finishes reassembling his A280. Talcon points out the viewport. “It looks like we’re here.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_RESPONSE_WAR,"[i]Talcon nods appreciatively. “Exactly. I fight so that people like Benex don’t have to.” The lieutenant points out the viewport. “It looks like we’re here.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_PLAYER_LAND,"Land the ship."
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_RESPONSE_LAND,"[i]You land the shuttle, taking note of the simple structures that dot the mountain’s base. Children play in the nearby meadow, while the residents move about their daily routine.\n\nA small group approaches the ship with a middle-aged woman in the lead.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_PLAYER_GREET,"Greet the villagers."
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_BENNEX INTRO,"[i]As you head down the ramp of the stolen shuttle, the woman addresses you. “You clearly aren’t Imperials. What brings you to the middle of nowhere?”\n\nA smile grows on the woman’s face as the lieutenant emerges from the ship. “Myra? Myra Talcon?”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_BENNEX INTRO,"[i]As you head down the ramp of the stolen shuttle, the woman addresses you. “You clearly aren’t Imperials. What brings you to the middle of nowhere in an Imperial shuttle?”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_PLAYER_MYRA,"Myra Talcon sent us."
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_RESPONSE_MYRA,"[i]“Myra?” The woman looks behind you, expectant. “Is she here with you?”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_PLAYER_MYRA_DEATH,"Tell her about Talcon's death."
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_PLAYER_LIE,"Lie."
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_RESPONSE_MYRA_DEATH,"[i]The woman looks away, processing a range of emotions before turning back to you.\n\n“Myra and I grew up together. When the Empire came to our planet, there were… unfortunate circumstances. Myra joined up with the Rebellion. I sought a different path. My name is Lesa Benex. Welcome to Haven.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_RESPONSE_LIE,"[i]You offer up a story about Lieutenant Talcon’s whereabouts, hoping it is enough to ease the woman’s mind.\n\nShe doesn’t seem entirely convinced, but she doesn’t press the issue. “If Myra sent you, then I will do what I can to help. My name is Lesa Benex. Welcome to Haven.""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_PLAYER_SITUATION,"Explain your situation."
ENCOUNTER_42_0S_RESPONSE_SITUATION,"[i]Benex nods in understanding. “I will provide assistance any way that I can. But if the Empire realizes you’re here, you endanger all of my people.” She gestures for you to follow her.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_1S_PLAYER_BENNEX,"You must be Benex."
ENCOUNTER_42_2S_1S_RESPONSE_BENNEX,"[i]“It seems my reputation precedes me,” Benex replies. Talcon finishes introductions and you explain your situation.\n\nBenex nods in understanding. “I will provide assistance any way that I can. But if the Empire realizes you’re here, you endanger all of my people.” She gestures for you to follow her.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_PLAYER_FOLLOW,"Follow Benex."
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_RESPONSE_FOLLOW,"[i]Benex walks you through the small village, stopping to occasionally answer questions from other villagers.\n\n“When my people were oppressed under the Empire, I had nowhere to go. I set up Haven to be a place where people can live in peace, away from the violence.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_PLAYER_UNDERSTAND,"We understand."
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_PLAYER_FIGHT,"Why didn't you fight?"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_RESPONSE_FIGHT,"[i]She looks at you, sadness in her eyes. “Refusing to fight doesn’t make me weak. It makes me strong enough to realize that violence doesn’t really solve anything. Beings in power will always use force to keep it. I chose not to become part of the cycle.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_FOOD,"[i]She ushers you into a large hut, where the smell of cooked meat and spices fills the air.\n\n“There will be plenty of time for more questions,"" Benex says. ""But for now, eat something. You can find me in the village when you need me.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_THANK,"Thank you."
ENCOUNTER_42_2S_SHUTTLE_RETURN,"[i]You finish eating and head back to the shuttle.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_2S_SHUTTLE_SEARCH_TEST,"[i]Talcon goes through the hold, scavenging anything useful.

ENCOUNTER_42_2S_SHUTTLE_FAIL,"[i]Unable to break in, you slam your fists on the console. Kish interrupts, giving you a wry smile. “I don’t think that works.

ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_RESPONSE_CHOLGANNA,"[i]A holographic image of General Sorin springs to life, his voice filling the cockpit.\n\n”The latest tests are very promising. The shield system is proving extremely effective against all conventional weapons, but continues to draw too much power. Once that hurdle is overcome, I can adapt this technology to other vehicles, or even starfighters. Then the Emperor will finally recognize my brilliance!”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_RESPONSE_ALEEN,"[i]A transparent blue image of General Sorin appears before you, excitement in his eyes.\n\n“I have just returned from the field site.

ENCOUNTER_42_ALL_AGREE,"Agreed."
ENCOUNTER_42_2S_END,"[i]You talk with Benex about leaving Talcon and Kish behind. ""Of course, they are welcome to stay as long as they need.""\n\nWith a plan in place, you launch the shuttle and leave your allies and the small mountain village behind.[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_43_0S_RESPONSE_SLOW_DOWN,"[i]The man’s fury does not subside. “A bounty hunter came in the night and took Benex.” Other villagers begin to gather, calling out to you for help in recovering their abducted leader.\n\nIf the Empire managed to track the shuttle, then you led them here.[/i]"

Eventually, they wander back to their homes, defeat and despair on their faces.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_43_ALL_RESPONSE_MISSION_2,"[i]With the crowd gone, an elderly Twi’lek woman approaches you, holoprojector in hand. “The hunter left this in Benex’s residence. I trust you to do the right thing.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_43_ALL_RESPONSE_FIX_TEST,"[i]You explain to the gathered villagers that you will do everything you can to bring Benex back. A few nod their heads in approval, but most seem skeptical.[/i]\n\nEach hero tests . Input the total ."
ENCOUNTER_43_2S_RESPONSE_FIX_PASS,"[i]Talcon’s unease lifts, along with the crowd’s.\n\nThe man who first confronted you steps forward and hands Kish a small holoprojector. “The bounty hunter left this.” He shifts uncomfortably. “I’m sorry for being so aggressive.

ENCOUNTER_43_ALL_RESPONSE_RECORDING,"[i]Returning to your ship, you activate the holoprojector and find yourself staring at the scarred visage of Dengar, the notorious bounty hunter.\n\n“I’ll keep this short. Ten thousand credits, delivered to Nar Shaddaa at the included coordinates today. Otherwise, Benex goes to the Imperials.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_43_2S_PLAYER_CONSULT,"Consult your allies."
ENCOUNTER_43_1S_PLAYER_CONSULT,"Consult Lieutenant Talcon."
ENCOUNTER_43_2S_1S_RESPONSE_CONSULT,"[i]As the holoprojection of the bounty hunter fades, Talcon turns to you. “I know the tank is a real threat to the Rebellion, but this is our fault. These villagers have a right to be angry. Benex gave us refuge when we had nowhere else to go.”[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_43_ALL_PLAYER_SHIELD,"What about the shield research?"

ENCOUNTER_43_0S_RESPONSE_SHIELD,"[i]You stare out the viewport, watching the villagers move about their routine, despair in their hearts.\n\nOn one hand, the tanks could turn the tide of the fight if you don't recover their shield specs from Cholganna. But your actions brought harm to Benex and her village. Shouldn’t you make that right?[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_43_2S_RESPONSE_WEAPON,"[i]Kish looks at Talcon, then turns to you. “I understand what the lieutenant is saying, but if we don’t acquire the weapon research from Aleen, we may never stop these tanks.

ENCOUNTER_43_1S_RESPONSE_WEAPON,"[i]Talcon turns away. “I know that the if we don’t acquire the weapon research from Aleen, the Rebellion could be lost. But I can’t just leave my friend in the hands of the Empire. It’s an impossible decision. I’m just glad I don’t have to make it.”[/i]"

Arnot, put me down and help these people load whatever provisions we can spare. They need to rejoin the Rebellion!""[/i]"

ENCOUNTER_44_MESSAGE,"[i]While loading the generous supplies, a hint of unnatural static catches your ear. You snoop around the shuttle, down into the hold. Reaching under a maintenance grate, you grip something metallic. You'd missed an Imperial transceiver!\n\nGeneral Sorin's voice crackles, ""Attention all troopers! The Rebel 'stronghold' was a defenseless village all along. Report to the flagship at Echo Base and prepare for invasion!""[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_44_GO,"[i]Almost losing Benex was enough; you won't let this village be destroyed for your war!\n\nIt's a long shot, but the ion cannon at the base should still be functional. With a little luck, you might shoot down Sorin's flagship before it leaves Hoth.[/i]"
ENCOUNTER_44_GO_2,"[i]You beg the woodcutter to return to Benex and to help the villagers seek refuge in the mountains. He leaves with a welcome sense of urgency and you set course for Hoth.[/i]"
