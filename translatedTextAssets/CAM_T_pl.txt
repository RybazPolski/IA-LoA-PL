TUT_NEW_1_DOUBLE_ACT_2P,"In two-player games, each [b]hero[/b] gets two [b]activations[/b] each round, indicated by the double portraits for each hero. When both heroes have taken their first activation, each hero becomes eligible to take its second. When both heroes have taken their second activation, the round ends."
TUT_NEW_1_DOUBLE_ACT_3P,"In three-player games, one [b]hero[/b] gets two [b]activations[/b] each round, indicated by the double portraits for that hero. When all heroes have taken their first activation, the hero with the double activation becomes eligible to take its second. When all four hero activations have been taken, the round ends and the extra activation passes to another hero."
TUT_NEW_1_HEROES_IN_PLACE,"Are all heroes in the spaces marked for them in the app?"
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_WAIT,"[i]Corporal Kish waits for you to complete your current objective.[/i]\n\nCorporal Kish performs no actions during his [b]activation[/b]. End his activation in the app."
TUT_NEW_1_OVERVIEW_1,"In [i]Imperial Assault[/i], 1–4 players take part in an epic [i]Star Wars[/i] adventure! Each player controls his or her own hero of the Rebel Alliance, and you must all work together to accomplish the goals of the campaign that you are playing. The campaign is played over a series of missions, and though you might lose individual missions, the campaign will continue until it reaches its conclusion. The fate of the Rebel Alliance is in your hands!"
TUT_NEW_1_OVERVIEW_3,"This tutorial will teach you how to play [i]Star Wars: Imperial Assault — Legends of the Alliance[/i]. This tutorial only provides a broad overview of the rules. Terms in [b]bold text[/b] refer to specific entries in the [i]Imperial Assault[/i] Rules Reference Guide included in your core set, where you can find more information on those topics."

TUT_NEW_1_LOG,"If you need to review past messages, you can find them in the message log by selecting the indicated icon. The message log also displays your current objective. When you are done, select anywhere outside of the message log to close it."
TUT_NEW_1_SET_THE_SCENE,"[i]You had just arrived at the Rebel base on Yavin as new recruits when the Death Star came to destroy the moon. Now that the Death Star has been destroyed, nearly everyone on the planet is preparing to evacuate the base. You, however, are to undergo training to become soldiers and, perhaps one day, legends of the Alliance.[/i]\n\n[i]Italicized text[/i] tells the story of what is happening in the game. Non-italicized text is rules and explanatory text that instructs you about what to do."
TUT_NEW_1_COMPONENTS,"Missions in [i]Imperial Assault[/i] are played on maps made up of double-sided tiles. The app will tell you which tiles you should place and when. If you need help identifying any of the game’s pieces, check the component list in the Learn to Play document that came with your [i]Imperial Assault[/i] core game."
TUT_NEW_1_TILES,"Gather the following tiles for this mission:\n\n01A\n02A\n05A\n06A\n09A\n10A\n17A\n18A (3 tiles)"
TUT_NEW_1_MAP_SETUP,"[i]The air is hot and thick with humidity. The sounds of the dense, lively jungle surround you on all sides.[/i]\n\nPlace tiles 02A, 18A and 1 door on the table as indicated. Place a [b]door[/b] token in a plastic stand on the edge indicated by the door icon. You can move the map around the screen by dragging it. You can also zoom in and out on the map."
TUT_NEW_1_HERO_PLACE,"[i]You are standing in a courtyard, surrounded on two sides by vine-covered fences. Behind you is an ancient stone structure, repurposed by your fellow Rebels into a makeshift base.[/i]\n\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, your heroes have been preselected."
TUT_NEW_1_JYN_PLACE,"Place the Jyn Odan figure in the indicated space. Choose a player to play as Jyn Odan and give that player the [b]Hero[/b] sheet and [b]Class cards[/b] with Jyn’s picture on them. Place the hero sheet with the red background side facedown. Class cards can be earned by the heroes over the course of a campaign. For now, keep the class cards facedown."
TUT_NEW_1_GAARKHAN_PLACE,"Place the Gaarkhan figure in the indicated space. Choose a player to play as Gaarkhan and give that player the [b]Hero[/b] sheet and [b]Class cards[/b] with Gaarkhan’s picture on them."
TUT_NEW_1_FENN_PLACE,"Place the Fenn Signis figure in the indicated space. Choose a player to play as Fenn Signis and give that player the [b]Hero[/b] sheet and [b]Class cards[/b] with Fenn’s picture on them."
TUT_NEW_1_GIDEON_PLACE,"Place the Gideon Argus figure in the indicated space. Choose a player to play as Gideon Argus and give that player the [b]Hero[/b] sheet and [b]Class cards[/b] with Gideon’s picture on them."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_PLACE,"[i]""At attention, soldiers!"" a voice calls out. A uniformed human stands at the top of a set of stone stairs, looking down over you. ""My name is Corporal Kish. I’m here to get you into fighting shape. The Alliance needs all the fighters it can get if we’re ever going to overthrow the Empire.""[/i]\n\nPlace a Rebel Trooper token on the indicated space. This Rebel Trooper is Corporal Kish."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_PLACE_2,"Place the gray Rebel Trooper [b]Deployment card[/b] (red card back with the Rebel () symbol) on the table where all players can see it. Normally [b]allies[/b] like the Rebel Trooper will be under the players’ control, but for the purpose of this tutorial, the app will tell you what to do with Corporal Kish."
TUT_NEW_1_ROUNDS,"Missions are divided into a number of rounds. Within each round, each figure ([b]hero[/b] and [b]ally[/b]) gets to perform one or more [b]activations[/b]. The round ends when all figures have finished their activations. The order in which Rebels perform their activations is decided by the players."
TUT_NEW_1_ACTIVATION,"During a figure’s [b]activation[/b], that figure performs up to two [b]actions[/b]. A figure can perform the same action more than once during its activation."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_ACT_1,"[i]""Let’s get moving,"" Kish says. ""We’ve got some combat training to do.""[/i]\n\nCorporal Kish will activate first."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_MOVE_PTS,"[i]Kish walks down the stairs and stops next to the gate leading out of the courtyard.[/i]\n\nCorporal Kish’s first [b]action[/b] will be a move action (for more detail, see [b]Movement[/b] in the Rules Reference Guide). When a figure takes a move action, that figure gains [b]movement points[/b] equal to the figure’s Speed as denoted on its Hero sheet or [b]Deployment card[/b] (4 in the case of the Rebel Trooper). Those movement points may only be used during the figure’s current [b]activation[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_MOVE_1,"It costs 1 [b]movement point[/b] for a figure to move to an [b]adjacent[/b] space (orthogonal or diagonal). Colored lines like those highlighted indicate the presence of [b]terrain[/b]. Black and red lines (both solid and dashed) block movement."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_MOVE_FIGURES,"Move Corporal Kish as indicated. The highlighted spaces indicate the path Corporal Kish took to move to the [b]door[/b], moving through Jyn’s space on the way. Figures can move through (but not stop in) spaces containing other figures. Moving through a space with a [b]hostile figure[/b] costs 1 additional [b]movement point[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DOOR,"[b]Doors[/b] are placed along edges and block [b]movement[/b] across those edges."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_INTERACT_1,"Tokens like this [b]door[/b] have their own rules that are defined by the mission. You can select a token on the map at any time to read the rules that apply to that token."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_INTERACT_2,"Above is the message you would see if you selected this [b]door[/b]. This door can be opened with an [b]interact[/b] action, as indicated by the "" Interact"" option. The arrow () icon indicates that this option requires an [b]action[/b]. To interact with a token, a figure must be on or [b]adjacent[/b] to the space containing that token.\n\nSelect the "" Interact"" option to have Corporal Kish open the door with his second action. You must close tutorial messages like this one before you can interact with other messages."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DOOR_OPENED,"[i]Corporal Kish pushes the ancient metal gate open to reveal the lush, dense jungle beyond.[/i]\n\nOpen the door (remove the token from the map). Place tiles 01A, 05A, 06A, 09A, 10A, 17A, and 18A (2). Note that the (2) indicates you will be using two copies of the tile 18A on the map."
TUT_NEW_1_CRATES_PLACE,"[i]Several crates containing your gear await you on the other side of the gate.[/i]\n\nPlace {0} [b]crate tokens[/b] as indicated."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_FINISH_MOVE,"[i]Corporal Kish steps through the gate and motions for you to follow him.[/i]\n\nBecause Corporal Kish has one [b]movement point[/b] remaining, he can spend it now to move one more space. Move Corporal Kish as indicated."
TUT_NEW_1_END_ACT,"Corporal Kish has taken two [b]actions[/b] (a move and an [b]interact[/b]) and spent all of his [b]movement points[/b], so his [b]activation[/b] is now complete. When a [b]hero[/b] or [b]ally[/b] finishes its activation, select its portrait to inform the app that the activation is complete. Then the next hero or ally will be able to take its activation."
TUT_NEW_1_EXTRA_ACT,"In games with fewer than four [b]heroes[/b], one or more heroes will have two portraits stacked one on top of the other. These heroes get to perform two [b]activations[/b] in a round. A hero cannot perform its second activation until each other hero has taken its first activation."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_END_ACT,"Use the app to end Corporal Kish’s [b]activation[/b] now."
TUT_NEW_1_GET_GEAR,"Grab your gear from the crates and follow Corporal Kish! Have each [b]hero[/b] perform an [b]activation,[/b] one at a time. Select a crate to learn the rules for interacting with [b]crate tokens[/b]. The "" Objective Updated "" at the bottom of this message indicates that you have a new objective. Remember, you can find your current objective in the message log at any time.\n\n  Objective Updated  \n\n(1 of 3) Open each [b]crate[/b] and follow Corporal Kish."
TUT_NEW_1_OBJECTIVE_GET_GEAR,"(1 of 3) Open each [b]crate[/b] and follow Corporal Kish."
TUT_NEW_1_WAIT_FOR_KISH,"[i]You arrive at the combat range ahead of Corporal Kish and have to wait for him to catch up.[/i]\n\nThe mission will progress at the end of the round. Make sure you inform the app each time you end a hero’s [b]activation[/b] by selecting that hero in the app."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_ACT_2,"[i]Corporal Kish takes off at a jog through the jungle.[/i]\n\nCorporal Kish will [b]activate[/b] next. He performs two move [b]actions[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_ACT_2b,"Move Corporal Kish as indicated. The highlighted spaces show where the corporal moved."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DIFF_TERRAIN,"Note that Corporal Kish spent two [b]movement points[/b] entering this space because it has [b]difficult terrain[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_GET_IN_PLACE,"[i]Having collected your gear, you head out to the combat range.[/i]\n\n  Objective Updated  \n\n(2 of 3) Perform [b]activations[/b] until each [b]hero[/b] occupies the space indicated for that hero in the app. When a hero is in its assigned spot, select its portrait on the map to inform the app."
TUT_NEW_1_DIFFICULT,"Note that these spaces contain [b]difficult terrain[/b], as indicated by the blue outline. To enter any of these spaces, the hero must spend 1 additional [b]movement point[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_OBJECTIVE_RANGE,"(2 of 3) Move each hero to the space marked with its portrait in the app. When a hero is in its assigned spot, select its portrait on the map to inform the app."
TUT_NEW_1_CRATES_LEFT,"Make sure you have opened all of the [b]crates[/b] before joining up with Corporal Kish."
TUT_NEW_1_IN_PLACE,"Is {0} in this space?"
TUT_NEW_1_IN_PLACE_END,"End the current hero’s activation to advance the mission."
TUT_NEW_1_TERMINAL_PLACE,"[i]""Alright, let’s get you some combat training,"" Kish says. He moves some branches away from a small computer terminal you hadn’t noticed before.[/i]\n\nPlace 1 [b]terminal token[/b] as indicated."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_TERMINAL_BREAKS,"[i]The corporal flips a couple of switches on the panel, but the terminal begins making a grinding sound and then goes black. Kish flicks the switch up and down several times, but the terminal shows no sign of life. ""Uh, are any of you handy with a wrench?"" he asks.[/i]\n\nThe terminal requires repairs. Fortunately, Jyn is good with technology, as indicated by the three dice of her Tech () [b]attribute[/b]. She will now attempt to pass a Tech () [b]attribute test[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_REMOTES_PLACE,"[i]The corporal flips a few switches on the terminal and a number of small, spherical training remotes deploy from a container hidden behind the terminal and spread out around the immediate area, hovering a few meters off the ground.[/i]\n\nPlace 6 neutral [b]mission tokens[/b] as indicated."
TUT_NEW_1_REMOTES_PLACE_2,"Neutral [b]mission tokens[/b] are used to represent a variety of things, from bystanders to secret passages. The rules for neutral mission tokens are defined in each mission. You can find these rules by selecting the token in the app. For this mission, these tokens represent training remotes."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DRAW,"[i]""We’ll use these remotes for target practice,"" Kish says. ""Allow me to demonstrate."" He pulls out his blaster pistol.[/i]\n\nCorporal Kish now [b]activates[/b] and wants to perform an [b]attack[/b]. Corporal Kish has a [b]ranged attack[/b], which is indicated by the  icon in the bottom-right corner of the Rebel Trooper card."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DRAW_ALT,"[i]""We’ll use these remotes for target practice,"" Kish says. ""Allow me to demonstrate."" He pulls out his blaster pistol.[/i]\n\nCorporal Kish now [b]activates[/b]. Normally an ally cannot activate twice in a round, but we are breaking this rule for demonstration purposes. Corporal Kish wants to perform an [b]attack[/b]. He has a [b]ranged attack[/b], which is indicated by the  icon in the bottom-right corner of the Rebel Trooper card."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_LOS,"To perform a [b]ranged attack[/b], a figure must have [b]line of sight[/b] to its [b]target[/b]. Let’s see which remotes Corporal Kish has in his sights."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_LOS_1,"[b]Line of sight[/b] requires that you are able to draw two uninterrupted imaginary lines from a single corner of the attacking figure’s space to two different corners of the [b]target[/b]’s space, as shown here. You can see from these sight lines that Corporal Kish does not have line of sight to this remote because line of sight cannot be drawn through spaces occupied by figures."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_LOS_2,"Similarly, Corporal Kish cannot see this remote because his sight lines go through Jyn’s space."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_LOS_3_4,"For these two remotes, Corporal Kish’s sight lines must pass through [b]walls[/b] (black lines), so he cannot see either of these remotes. Note that [b]blocking terrain[/b] (solid red lines) also blocks [b]line of sight[/b], but [b]impassable terrain[/b] (dashed red lines) does not."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_LOS_5_6,"Corporal Kish has [b]line of sight[/b] to each of these two remotes.\n\nFor more examples of line of sight, see Appendix I in the Rules Reference Guide."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_ATK_MOVE,"Corporal Kish will perform a move [b]action[/b] to get closer to his [b]target[/b]. Move Corporal Kish as indicated."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_AIM,"[i]The corporal raises his pistol to eye level and takes aim at the nearest remote.[/i]\n\nCorporal Kish will now perform an [b]attack[/b]. Note that he still has [b]line of sight[/b] to the remote from his new space. Roll the attack dice shown next to the  icon on the Rebel Trooper card (1 blue die and 1 yellow die) to perform Corporal Kish’s attack now."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_ACC,"Now add up the numbers shown on the [b]attack[/b] dice you rolled to determine the attack’s [b]Accuracy[/b]. The remote that the corporal is targeting is two spaces away, so if the attack’s Accuracy is at least 2, then the attack hits."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DMG,"Now to determine [b]damage[/b]. Count the number of damage () icons showing on the two [b]attack[/b] dice and place that many damage tokens next to the remote on the map. If the remote has damage tokens equal to or exceeding its [b]Health[/b] of 3, the remote is destroyed. Remember you can find a token’s rules, including its Health, by selecting it in the app. (See [b]Attacking Objects[/b] for more information.) When a remote is destroyed, select it in the app and choose the ""Destroy"" option.\n\nResolve Corporal Kish’s attack against the remote by placing the appropriate number of damage () tokens next to the remote. Does the remote have at least 3 damage () tokens next to it?"
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_SURGE,"You may have rolled one or more [b]surge[/b] () icons on the [b]attack[/b] dice. Ignore those icons for now. They will be discussed later."
TUT_NEW_1_MELEE,"Gaarkhan’s Vibro-Ax does not have the [b]ranged attack[/b] () icon, but instead has the [b]melee attack[/b] () icon. Figures with melee attacks () must be in the same space as or [b]adjacent[/b] to their [b]target[/b] to [b]attack[/b]. Melee attacks ignore [b]Accuracy[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_TAKE_EM_OUT,"[i]""Now that you’ve seen how it’s done, show me what you’ve got,"" Corporal Kish says, stepping back next to the terminal.[/i]\n\nMove Corporal Kish as indicated using his remaining [b]movement points[/b] and end his [b]activation[/b] in the app. Then perform [b]attacks[/b] against the remotes until they are all [b]defeated[/b].\n\n  Objective Updated  \n\n(3 of 3) [b]Defeat[/b] all of the remotes."
TUT_NEW_1_TAKE_EM_OUT_ALT,"[i]""Now that you’ve seen how it’s done, show me what you’ve got,"" Corporal Kish says, stepping back next to the terminal.[/i]\n\nMove Corporal Kish as indicated using his remaining [b]movement points[/b]. Then perform [b]attacks[/b] against the remotes until they are all [b]defeated[/b].\n\n  Objective Updated  \n\n(3 of 3) [b]Defeat[/b] all of the remotes."
TUT_NEW_1_OBJECTIVE_DEFEAT,"(3 of 3) [b]Defeat[/b] all of the remotes."
TUT_NEW_1_DEFEAT_REMIND,"Remember to [b]defeat[/b] remotes in the app when you destroy them."
TUT_NEW_1_SURGES,"[b]Surge[/b] () icons allow you to enhance your [b]attacks[/b]. For each surge icon rolled during an attack, the attacker may use one surge ability; each surge ability can only be used once per attack.\n\nSurge abilities are listed on each [b]ally[/b]’s Deployment card and each hero’s weapon card."
TUT_NEW_1_SURGES_2,"Let’s discuss some of the [b]surge[/b] abilities that you will encounter during this tutorial.\n\n"": +1"" adds 1 icon to the [b]attack[/b] results.\n\n"": +1 Accuracy"" improves the [b]Accuracy[/b] of the attack."
TUT_NEW_1_OTHER_SURGES,""": [b]Pierce[/b] 1"" is used to counter a [b]target[/b]’s defenses and will be discussed in more detail later.\n\n"": [b]Cleave[/b] 1"" allows the attacking figure to deal 1 [b]damage[/b] () to something other than the [b]target[/b] of the [b]attack[/b]. If Gaarkhan is [b]adjacent[/b] to two remotes when he attacks one of them, he can use Cleave to place 1 damage on another remote he is adjacent to."
TUT_NEW_1_REMIND_OBJ,"Continue performing [b]activations[/b] until you have [b]defeated[/b] all of the remotes."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_HARD_REMOTES,"[i]""Well done taking out those remotes,"" the corporal says. ""I think you need a harder challenge. Let’s see how you do with level-2 remotes."" He flips a few switches on the panel, and the remotes begin moving and rotating unpredictably.[/i]"
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DEFENSE_DICE,"The remaining remotes now have a defense die. There are two colors of defense dice: black and white. The remotes roll a white defense die. When [b]attacking[/b] a [b]target[/b] that has one or more defense dice, roll those defense dice at the same time that you roll your attack dice."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_DEFENSE_DICE_2,"Each block () rolled on the defense dice cancels one [b]damage[/b] () and each evade () rolled cancels one [b]surge[/b] (). If a defense die shows a dodge () symbol, the attack [b]misses[/b] and the target takes no damage. For more details on defense dice, see [b]Attacks[/b] in the Rules Reference Guide."
TUT_NEW_1_KISCH_PIERCE,"The [b]Pierce[/b] surge ability can be used to ignore block () symbols. For example, using a Pierce 2 ability allows 2 icons to be ignored."
TUT_NEW_1_TAKE_EM_OUT_2,"[i]""Alright, take out these new remotes and then..."" The corporal is interrupted by the chirping of his comlink. He listens to the device for a moment, then continues. ""That was the command center. I’m needed back at base. Take out those remotes. I should be back by the time you are done.""[/i]\n\nRemove Corporal Kish from the map. Perform [b]activations[/b] until you have [b]defeated[/b] the rest of the remotes."
TUT_NEW_1_WIN,"[i]The last remote is just exploding in a ball of sparks and fire when a signal comes across all comlink channels. ""Alert! Alert! Imperial forces have landed! Begin evacuation procedures immediately!"" You decide you had better get back to base...[/i]"
TUT_NEW_1_DOOR,"[i]An ancient, rusty gate leads out of the courtyard.[/i]\n\nA Rebel may [b]interact[/b] with this [b]door[/b] to open it."
TUT_NEW_1_TERMINAL_FIX,"Jyn Odan tests Tech ().\n\nTo perform an [b]attribute test[/b], roll the dice listed next to the indicated attribute, in this case Tech (), and enter the number of surge () icons you got on your dice below. Ignore any numbers and damage () symbols on the dice. The app will inform you if you succeeded based on the number of your successes."
TUT_NEW_1_TERMINAL_FIX_FAIL,"[i]You open up the terminal and rummage around inside. You close up the terminal and flip a switch, but the machine is still unresponsive. You kick the terminal out of frustration, and the jolt causes it to power back to life.[/i]"
TUT_NEW_1_TERMINAL_FIX_SUCCESS,"[i]You open up the terminal and quickly find the source of the problem. After a quick bypass, you close up the terminal and flip a switch, bringing the machine back to life. ""Nice job,"" Corporal Kish says.[/i]"
TUT_NEW_1_CRATE,"[i]This crate contains equipment for one of the members of your team.[/i]\n\nA hero can [b]interact[/b] to open this [b]crate[/b]."
TUT_NEW_1_CRATE_FIRST_SELECT,"[b]Crates[/b] like this one contain useful items that help the [b]heroes[/b] during a mission. Opening a crate requires an [b]interact[/b] action. The highlighted spaces are valid spaces from which to interact with this crate. Note that figures can end their [b]movement[/b] in a space with a crate."
TUT_NEW_1_CRATE_FIRST_CLAIM,"After a hero [b]interacts[/b] with a [b]crate[/b], that crate is removed from the map."
TUT_NEW_1_CRATE_JYN,"[i]You open the crate and find a blaster pistol inside.[/i]\n\nThe player for Jyn Odan searches Jyn’s [b]Class cards[/b] for the card called ""Vintage Blaster"" and places it faceup next to Jyn’s Hero sheet. This is Jyn’s starting weapon. In a typical mission, you would start with this card in play. For details about weapons, see [b]Item Cards[/b] in the Rules Reference Guide."
TUT_NEW_1_CRATE_GAARKHAN,"[i]You open the crate and find a vibro-ax inside.[/i]\n\nThe player for Gaarkhan searches Gaarkhan’s [b]Class cards[/b] for the card called ""Vibro-Ax"" and places it faceup next to Gaarkhan’s Hero sheet. This is Gaarkhan’s starting weapon. In a typical mission, you would start with this card in play. For details about weapons, see [b]Item Cards[/b] in the Rules Reference Guide."

For example, you should ignore the [b]Squad Training[/b] ability on all Stormtrooper Deployment cards.

TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_BONUS,"This is a bonus that this [b]group[/b] gets during its [b]activation[/b]. In this case, each Stormtrooper adds one [b]surge[/b] () icon to its [b]attack[/b] during its activation. Bonuses can change each time a group activates, so you should check the bonus each time you activate an Imperial group."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_INSTR,"[b]Imperial figures[/b] act according to a list of instructions. One at a time, each figure in the [b]group[/b] will perform each of its [b]activation[/b] instructions in order, starting from the top. If a figure cannot perform an instruction, it will skip the instruction and proceed to the next one."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_INSTR_2,"Some [b]activation[/b] instructions have one or two action icons ( or ) in front of them. An [b]Imperial figure[/b] cannot perform instructions with more than a combined total of 2 action icons during its activation. If an instruction would bring a figure’s total to more than 2 action icons, it will skip that instruction.\n\nAdditionally, Imperial figures can only perform one instruction preceded by a ."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A,"Normally you get to decide the [b]activation[/b] order for figures in an Imperial group, but for the purpose of this tutorial, let’s start with the highlighted Stormtrooper."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_INSTR,"The first instruction these Stormtroopers have is:\n"" [b]Move 3[/b] to [b]attack[/b] « the closest Rebel ».""\n""[b]Move 3[/b]"" indicates that this Stormtrooper will spend up to 3 [b]movement points[/b] to try to perform the rest of the instruction, in this case an [b]attack[/b]. When a figure is moving to perform an attack, it will try to get as close as possible to its [b]target[/b]."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_SHORTEST_PATH,"When an [b]Imperial figure[/b] moves, it will take the shortest path (in terms of [b]movement points[/b]) possible to reach its destination.\n\nYou can ignore the Speed value on the Imperial figure’s [b]Deployment card[/b] when using the [b]move[/b] keyword."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A1,"This Stormtrooper has only one valid place to end its movement, the highlighted space. This space is as close as the Stormtrooper can get to the closest Rebel, Gaarkhan, with its 3 [b]movement points[/b].\n\nMove the highlighted Stormtrooper as indicated."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_TRACKING,"Even though this tutorial will tell you where to place and move figures at times, this is for demonstration purposes only. During a typical mission, the app does not track where any figures, Rebel or Imperial, are on the map."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_ATTACK,"Now the Stormtrooper will perform an [b]attack[/b] against its preferred [b]target[/b], the closest Rebel, indicated by the text inside the « » symbols. In this case, the closest Rebel is Gaarkhan. The Stormtrooper card shows that this Stormtrooper rolls 1 blue and 1 green die for its [b]ranged attack[/b] (). Gaarkhan’s player rolls those dice, along with Gaarkhan’s defense die (1 black die).\n\nRoll for the Stormtrooper’s attack now."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_ATTACK2,"As with any [b]ranged ([/b][b]) attack[/b], check to see if the attack has sufficient [b]Accuracy[/b] to hit. Then the Stormtrooper will spend any [b]surges[/b] it rolled, including the free surge it received from its bonus."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_SURGE,"For each [b]surge[/b] the Stormtrooper rolled, consult the Surge Priority list by selecting the  Priority button. Selecting the button again will close the Surge Priority list."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_SURGE2,"The Stormtrooper will spend its [b]surges[/b] on the topmost surge ability that would have an effect on the [b]attack[/b] and that has not already been used. Since the attack already has sufficient [b]Accuracy[/b] to hit its target, the Stormtrooper will skip the +2 Accuracy surge ability and use the next ability to add +1."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_DAMAGE,"Remember that each block () icon rolled on the defense die cancels one [b]damage[/b] () icon, and each evade () icon cancels one surge () icon.\n\nFinish the attack by placing damage tokens on the target hero’s Hero sheet equal to the number of unblocked  icons from the dice and the surge ability."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_ACTIONS,"The Stormtrooper has now performed one instruction with an [b]action[/b] icon (), so it can only perform one more instruction with an action icon. Because the Stormtrooper performed an [b]attack[/b] (indicated by the  icon), it cannot perform another attack instruction."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_MOVE,"Let’s see what this Stormtrooper will do next. We go to the next instruction in the list:\n"" [b]Move 2[/b] to [b]reposition 4[/b].""\nLet’s take a look at the map to see what that means."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_REPO,"""[b]Reposition 4[/b]"" means the figure will attempt to [b]move[/b] to a space from which the nearest Rebel figure is 4 spaces away (see [b]Counting Spaces[/b] in the Rules Reference Guide). Figures will always perform this action, even if the figure cannot get 4 spaces away. The highlighted spaces are all 3 spaces away from {0}, which is the furthest the Stormtrooper can get from him."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_REPO2,"Note that while these two spaces are 3 spaces away from Gaarkhan, they are only 2 spaces away from Jyn. This Stormtrooper wants to be as close to 4 spaces away from both Gaarkhan and Jyn as possible, so it will not move to either of these spaces."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_REPO3,"These two spaces are 3 spaces from Gaarkhan and at least 4 spaces away from the other heroes, so these two spaces are equally valid for the Stormtrooper to reposition to. So which one will the Stormtrooper move to? This is a case where the [b]Imperial Rule[/b] applies."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_REPO4,"When there are two or more valid options for an [b]Imperial figure[/b], the players as a group should decide which option is least beneficial to the heroes and choose that option. This is known as the [b]Imperial Rule[/b]. However, there’s no time for indecision in combat, so if multiple options are roughly equal in their disadvantages for the heroes or if the players cannot agree, pick one at random."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_REPO5,"In this case, the indicated space is slightly better for the Stormtrooper because it puts the trooper out of the heroes’ [b]line of sight[/b], so it will spend its 2 [b]movement points[/b] to move to this space.\n\nMove the Stormtrooper to the highlighted space."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_A_DONE,"This Stormtrooper has performed instructions with two action icons, and its remaining instructions all have an action icon, so it cannot perform any more instructions. It has now finished its [b]activation[/b], so now the other two will activate."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_B,"Let’s [b]activate[/b] this Stormtrooper next. Like the previous Stormtrooper, its first instruction is:\n"" [b]Move 3[/b] to [b]attack[/b] « the closest Rebel »."""
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_B1,"The Stormtrooper wants to get as close as possible to its target, so it will move to this space.\n\nMove the Stormtrooper to the indicated space."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_B_ATTACK,"Now the Stormtrooper will [b]attack[/b] the closest Rebel. Since there is more than one Rebel equally close to the Stormtrooper, you will need to decide which one gets attacked. Don’t forget the Imperial Rule! Then perform the attack as before.\n\nPerform an attack against Gaarkhan or Fenn, and then select ""Continue."""
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_B_ATTACK_2P,"Now the Stormtrooper will [b]attack[/b] the closest Rebel. Perform the attack as before.\n\nPerform an attack against {0}, and then select ""Continue."""
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_B_MOVE,"Now that the Stormtrooper has completed that instruction, it is time for its next instruction:\n"" [b]Move 2[/b] to [b]reposition 4[/b]."""
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_B_REPO,"The Stormtrooper will use its 2 [b]movement points[/b] to try to get to a space that is 4 spaces from the nearest Rebel. It cannot do that, but it can get to the highlighted spaces, which are each 3 spaces away. Choose the space that seems the least advantageous for the heroes, or pick one at random, and move the Stormtrooper to that space."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_B_REPO_4P,"The Stormtrooper will use its 2 [b]movement points[/b] to try to get to a space that is 4 spaces from the nearest Rebel. The highlighted space is at least 3 spaces from each hero, so it is the best option for the Stormtrooper. Move the Stormtrooper to that space."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_C,"Finally, it’s time for the last Stormtrooper to [b]activate[/b]. You now have the knowledge you need to activate the last Stormtrooper in this [b]group[/b].\n\nActivate the last Stormtrooper, then select ""Finish."" If you need to see something on the map, the ""View Map"" button below will minimize the Imperial activation window. Select the ""Activation"" button that appears to reopen the activation window."
TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_C_DONE,"Did the third Stormtrooper end its [b]activation[/b] in one of the highlighted spaces? If so, you got everything right, especially if it ended up behind the [b]blocking terrain[/b]. Now it’s time to fight back!"
TUT_NEW_2_OBJECTIVE_TROOPERS,"(1 of 4) Defeat the Stormtrooper group."

TUT_NEW_2_TROOPERS_DEF_ASK,"Did you manage to take out a Stormtrooper? When the entire [b]group[/b] is [b]defeated[/b], inform the app by selecting the group’s icon on the right side of the screen. It is important to do this as soon as the group is defeated or else the app might choose a defeated group to be the next Imperial group to activate."
TUT_NEW_2_DEFEAT,"Heroes can be [b]defeated[/b] as well. When a hero suffers [b]damage[/b] () equal to its [b]Health[/b], that hero becomes [b]wounded[/b]. Remove all damage tokens from that hero’s sheet, and flip the sheet over to the wounded (red) side. Then select the hero’s portrait in the app and use the button to the left of the portrait to inform the app that the hero was wounded."
TUT_NEW_2_BONUS_HEALTH,"Note that each hero has a +{0} next to its portrait. This indicates that each hero has an extra {0} [b]Health[/b] for this mission. This applies to any mission with {1} players."

After you complete this mission, you will be ready to embark on a campaign!"
TUT_NEW_3_DOCS,"The primary reference document for this tutorial is the [i]Imperial Assault[/i] Rules Reference Guide included in your core set. Words in [b]bold text[/b] refer to specific entries in the Rules Reference Guide, as well as the [i]Legends of the Alliance[/i] Rulebook, which can be accessed through the Rules button in the menu."
TUT_NEW_3_TILES,"Gather the following tiles for this mission:\n\n02A\n18A\n24B\n36B\n38B"
TUT_NEW_3_PLACE_TILES,"[i]You are in a hastily constructed durasteel enclosure that provides additional space beyond the ancient stone structures that house most of the base’s occupants.[/i]\n\nPlace tiles 24B, 36B, and 1 door."
TUT_NEW_3_PLACE_JYN,"[i]You stand near the door that you just rolled under in order to escape the Imperial forces outside.[/i]\n\nPlace Jyn Odan as indicated."
TUT_NEW_3_PLACE_GAARKHAN,"Place Gaarkhan as indicated."
TUT_NEW_3_PLACE_FENN,"Place Fenn Signis as indicated."
TUT_NEW_3_PLACE_GIDEON,"Place Gideon Argus as indicated."
TUT_NEW_3_STARTING_CARDS,"Each player takes one hero’s Hero sheet (full-color side faceup) and that hero’s [b]Class cards[/b], with only the starting weapon card faceup."
TUT_NEW_3_PLACE_CRATES,"[i]The room is mostly stripped bare of anything useful, but a couple of crates remain behind, forgotten in the rush to evacuate.[/i]\n\nPlace 2 crates."
TUT_NEW_3_DOOR_OPENS,"[i]The sound of blaster fire impacting the base door echoes through the room. You ready your weapons and prepare to face the Imperial forces head on. After several moments, the blasts stop, leaving you in tense silence.[/i]"
TUT_NEW_3_DOOR_OPENS_2,"[i]A few moments later, a small explosion rocks the structure and leaves a gaping hole in the door.[/i]\n\nOpen the door. Place tiles 02A, 18A, and 38B."
TUT_NEW_3_STORMTROOPERS,"[i]Through the hole in the door, you see a squad of stormtroopers gathered outside. Two of them stand back, weapons at the ready, while a third has pressed up against the side of the structure to get clear of the blasting charges.[/i]\n\nDeploy a regular Stormtrooper group. Assign it a color."
TUT_NEW_3_CHARGE,"[i]With a ferocious battle roar, Gaarkhan charges toward the open door and the stormtroopers beyond.[/i]\n\nGaarkhan will activate first for demonstration purposes."
TUT_NEW_3_CHARGE_2,"Some heroes have special [b]actions[/b] (indicated by an  icon) listed on their Hero sheets that provide them additional options during their activations. Each special action can only be used once per activation."
TUT_NEW_3_CHARGE_3,"Gaarkhan has the Charge special [b]action[/b], which reads:\n\n2: Move a number of spaces up to your Speed. Then, you may perform an [b]attack[/b] with a  weapon.\n\nThis ability requires that Gaarkhan spend an action () and suffer 2 [b]strain[/b] (indicated by the 2) to perform."
TUT_NEW_3_STRAIN,"When a hero suffers [b]strain[/b] (), place strain tokens on that hero’s Hero sheet. A hero can only voluntarily suffer an amount of strain () up to its [b]Endurance[/b]. For example, if Gaarkhan had 3 or 4 strain on his hero sheet, he could not choose to use his Charge ability."
TUT_NEW_3_CHARGE_4,"Place 2 [b]strain[/b] () tokens on Gaarkhan’s Hero sheet to use Gaarkhan’s Charge [b]ability[/b]. Move Gaarkhan [b]adjacent[/b] to the two Stormtroopers farthest from him so that he can take advantage of his Vibro-Ax’s [b]Cleave[/b] ability. Then perform an attack with Gaarkhan."
TUT_NEW_3_GAARKHAN_ACTION_2,"Using his Charge [b]ability[/b] only took one of Gaarkhan’s two [b]actions[/b]. Perform a second action now for Gaarkhan, and then end his [b]activation[/b]. Remember that he cannot use Charge again this activation because special actions can only be used once per activation."
TUT_NEW_3_INTERRUPT,"Some hero [b]abilities[/b] are able to [b]interrupt[/b] the normal flow of the game. Jyn Odan’s Quick Draw is one such ability. It reads:\n\n2: Use at the start of a hostile figure’s activation. Interrupt to perform an attack with a [i]Pistol[/i] targeting that figure. Limit once per round (twice if you have 2 activation tokens)."
TUT_NEW_3_QUICK_DRAW,"With Quick Draw, Jyn can [b]interrupt[/b] an Imperial figure’s activation to perform an attack by suffering 2 [b]strain[/b] (). She can only do this once per round, as stated in the ability’s text. During rounds when Jyn has two portraits shown in the app (which is the app equivalent of 2 activation tokens), she can use Quick Draw twice.\n\nJyn is in a perfect position to Quick Draw on the closest Stormtrooper. Place 2 strain () tokens on her Hero sheet and perform an attack against that Stormtrooper. If you manage to defeat it, remove it from the map. It does not get to finish its activation."
TUT_NEW_3_OPPORTUNIST,"If Jyn managed to do at least 1 [b]damage[/b] () to the Stormtrooper, she can now use her Opportunist [b]ability[/b] to [b]move 1 space[/b]. Since Opportunist does not have a [b]strain[/b] () cost listed for it, it does not cost strain to use. Then finish the [b]activation[/b] for any remaining Stormtroopers. If Jyn and Gaarkhan managed to [b]defeat[/b] the entire [b]group[/b], the Stormtrooper activation ends, and it becomes the heroes’ turn to activate."
TUT_NEW_3_PLACE_NEXU,"[i]A large, fearsome-looking animal climbs over the base’s perimeter fence.[/i]\n\nDeploy a regular Nexu. The Nexu has a Mercenary [b]affiliation[/b], so its [b]Deployment card[/b] will have a green back with the Mercenary icon () on it. Figures with either Mercenary () or Imperial () affiliation are considered [b]Imperial figures[/b]. Place the Nexu’s Deployment card on the table for reference."
TUT_NEW_3_MOBILE,"This Nexu has the [b]Mobile[/b] keyword on its [b]Deployment card,[/b] which allows it to ignore [b]terrain[/b], so the Nexu can move into and stop on spaces containing [b]blocking terrain,[/b] as it is doing here."
TUT_NEW_3_LARGE_BASE,"The Nexu is also a [b]large figure[/b] because its base is larger than a single space. There are two main differences between large and small figures:\n• Large figures cannot move diagonally. For examples of large figure movement, see Appendix II in the Rules Reference Guide.\n• When drawing [b]line of sight[/b] to a large figure, you only need to draw sight lines to two adjacent corners of any one of the spaces it occupies."
TUT_NEW_3_CUNNING,"The Nexu has the Cunning [b]ability[/b] on its [b]Deployment card[/b]. This ability gives it an extra block () when it rolls an evade () while defending. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the abilities that [b]Imperial figures[/b] have on their Deployment cards when they are deployed. Remember that any ability that uses the word ""may"" or ""choose"" should be ignored when playing [i]Legends of the Alliance[/i]. You can also ignore special actions (indicated by one or more  icons) on Imperial Deployment cards."
TUT_NEW_3_HERO_TURN,"It is now the heroes’ turn to [b]activate[/b].\n\n  Objective Updated  \n\n(1 of 3) Attack the Imperial forces until the last transport is away."
TUT_NEW_3_CONDITIONS,"The Nexu has the [b]Bleed[/b] keyword on its [b]Deployment card[/b], which allows it to give the Bleed [b]condition[/b] to figures it damages with its attacks. Conditions like Bleed are lasting effects. When a figure gains a condition, place a token for that condition next to that figure. Each condition has a reference card that describes its effects, including the way in which it is removed.\n\nSome conditions, like Bleed and [b]Stun[/b], are [i]Harmful[/i], as indicated by the trait on the Condition card and their purple color. Others, like [b]Focus[/b], are [i]Beneficial[/i], which are colored green."
TUT_NEW_3_CONDITIONS_2,"Some weapons and [b]Deployment cards[/b] have [b]surge[/b] abilities that apply [b]conditions[/b]. For example, the Royal Guards from the last tutorial had the surge ability: "": Stun."" When such an ability is used, if the [b]target[/b] suffers at least 1 [b]damage[/b] () during the attack, then that condition is applied either to the target of the attack (if the condition is [i]Harmful[/i]) or to the attacker (if the condition is [i]Beneficial).[/i]\n\nThe Nexu is not required to spend a surge to trigger its [b]Bleed[/b] ability, but it must do at least 1 damage to its target in order for the target to become Bleeding."
TUT_NEW_3_RAGE,"Gaarkhan’s Rage [b]ability[/b] allows him to gain the [b]Focus[/b] condition when he suffers at least 3 damage () during a single attack. A figure cannot gain a [b]condition[/b] that it currently has, so Gaarkhan cannot use Rage if he is already Focused."
TUT_NEW_3_OTHER_ABILITIES_3,"Fenn has [b]abilities[/b] on his Hero sheet that are not covered in this tutorial. You should familiarize yourselves with those abilities now. Refer to the Rules Reference Guide if you have any questions about those abilities."
TUT_NEW_3_OTHER_ABILITIES_4,"Fenn and Gideon have [b]abilities[/b] on their Hero sheets that are not covered in this tutorial. You should familiarize yourselves with those abilities now. Refer to the Rules Reference Guide if you have any questions about those abilities."
TUT_NEW_3_ACTIVATE_NEXU,"Perform the Nexu’s [b]activation[/b] now. Remember that [b]Imperial figures[/b] can only perform one action with a  icon each activation."
TUT_NEW_3_STRAIN_MOVE,"Sometimes a hero just needs to move a space or two to get next to a [b]crate[/b] or get [b]line of sight[/b] to an enemy, which makes a move [b]action[/b] less than ideal. Heroes always have the inherent [b]ability[/b] to suffer 1 [b]strain[/b] () to gain 1 [b]movement point[/b] during their [b]activation[/b]. They can do this up to twice per activation. This is an invaluable tool for saving a hero’s actions for more important uses like [b]attacking[/b] or [b]interacting[/b]."
TUT_NEW_3_REST,"With many [b]abilities[/b] that require suffering [b]strain[/b] (), heroes can quickly find themselves with strain equal to their [b]Endurance[/b]. To remove this strain, heroes need to perform a [b]rest[/b] action. When a hero rests, that hero removes all strain from its Hero sheet.\n\n[b]Important:[/b] This app changes the rules for resting from those presented in the Rules Reference Guide. Resting in [i]Legends of the Alliance[/i] does not allow a hero to [b]recover[/b] damage. Recovering damage will be discussed later in this tutorial."
TUT_NEW_3_SURGE_RECOVERY,"There is one other way that heroes can remove [b]strain[/b] (). When a hero is attacking, that hero can spend one surge () result to remove one strain from its Hero sheet. This can be done even if the attack [b]misses[/b]. A hero may only do this once per attack."
TUT_NEW_3_CRATE,"[i]A crate of supplies got left behind in the scramble to evacuate.[/i]\n\nA hero can [b]interact[/b] to open this [b]crate[/b]. Remember a hero must be [b]adjacent[/b] and spend an [b]action[/b] to interact."
TUT_NEW_3_CRATE_CLAIM,"[i]You found some useful supplies.[/i]\n\nThe hero who opened this [b]crate[/b] draws 1 [b]Supply card[/b] from the Supply deck. Make sure the cards listed in step 1 of the Setup section of the [i]Legends of the Alliance[/i] Rulebook have been removed from the Supply deck. A Supply card provides a special ability to the hero that possesses it. Supply cards cannot be traded.\n\nYou also gained 50 credits. Credits are tracked by the app and can be spent between missions to gain new [b]Item cards[/b]."
TUT_NEW_3_MEDICAL_CLAIMED,"[i]You found a medpac inside![/i]\n\nYou gained 1 medpac. Your medpac count is indicated at the bottom of the screen. Medpacs are used for [b]recovering[/b] damage (). You will typically begin a mission with one or more medpacs and can find more medpacs over the course of a mission. Medpacs do not carry over between missions, so use them when you need them."
TUT_NEW_3_MED_PACKS_1,"After a hero performs a rest action, that hero can spend a medpac during that figure’s [b]activation[/b] to [b]recover[/b] up to 5 [b]damage[/b] (), which removes that much damage from the figure.\n\nTo use a medpac, select the Medpacs button, highlighted below."
TUT_NEW_3_MED_PACKS_2,"Medpacs are in short supply for the Rebellion, so you better use them wisely. You need to achieve your goals quickly, or else you will find yourselves taking more damage than you can shake off. If all heroes are [b]wounded[/b] during a mission, you will have to be extracted before you can accomplish your objectives, and Alliance High Command won’t be happy about that."
TUT_NEW_3_OBJECTIVE_OFFICER,"(2 of 3) Defeat the Imperial Officer."
TUT_NEW_3_DEPLOY_OFFICER,"[i]An officer strides through the gate.[/i]\n\nDeploy an elite Imperial Officer. [b]Elite figures[/b] are stronger versions of regular figures and use red [b]Deployment cards[/b] instead of gray ones. Note that this Imperial Officer has 3 bonus Health, indicated by the +3 on its icon in the app.\n\n  Objective Updated  \n\n(2 of 3) Defeat the Imperial Officer."
TUT_NEW_3_DEPLOY,"[i]The officer looks at you with disdain before barking orders at the forces accompanying him to destroy you.[/i]\n\nSometimes the app will deploy Imperial groups at random from your collection. These deployments are indicated by a chance cube icon next to the group’s portrait on the right side of the screen. The app will highlight a space on the map, and you should place each figure in that group as close to that space as possible."
TUT_NEW_3_OFFICER_ORDER,"Imperial Officers prefer for others to do the fighting for them. To that end, this figure will attempt to [b]Order[/b] another Imperial figure to attack the Rebel closest to itself. If there is no eligible figure that can attack that Rebel, use targeting priority to pick the next best target. If no other Imperial figure can perform an attack, skip the instruction."
TUT_NEW_3_OFFICER_FREE,"This Imperial Officer has an instruction preceded by a •. This symbol indicates that this instruction does not require an [b]action[/b] (), and so this instruction will always be performed if its conditions are met; it does not count toward the two action () instructions that the figure can perform during its [b]activation[/b]."
TUT_NEW_3_OBJECTIVE_CRATES,"(3 of 3) Open all of the crates."
TUT_NEW_3_GET_THE_CRATES,"[i]""The last transport is preparing to depart,"" Lieutenant Talcon reports via comlink. ""Grab any supplies you can carry and head toward your ships!""[/i]\n\n  Objective Updated  \n\n(3 of 3) Open all of the [b]crates[/b]."
TUT_NEW_3_REWARD_SCREEN,"This is the Mission Reward window. It shows you how much fame and how many credits you earned over the course of this mission, as well as bonuses for finishing the mission. At the bottom are items that the Rebel Alliance has allocated to your team as a reward for your service. Select outside of the Mission Reward window to close it."

[i]Italicized text[/i] is story text. Non-italicized text is rules and instructional text."
TUT_VET_ALL_TILES,"Gather the following tiles for this mission:\n\n01A\n02A\n18A (2)\n22B\n24B\n36B\n38B"

TUT_VET_INTRO_HEROES,"[i]You pass through the gate, which is closed behind you. ""Keep your eyes open for any sign of Imperial soldiers,"" you hear through your comlink’s earpiece. ""We may have destroyed the Empire’s Death Star, but they still know we are here on Yavin 4, so we can’t have them sneak up on us while we are evacuating the base.""[/i]"
TUT_VET_INTRO_HERO,"Place {0} on the indicated space. One player takes {0}'s Hero sheet and starting weapon."
TUT_VET_INTRO_TROOPERS,"[i]Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your eye. A squad of Imperial stormtroopers has ambushed you![/i]\n\nDeploy 3 Stormtroopers to the indicated spaces and place a regular Stormtrooper card on the table for reference. Then choose a color for this group below. This color helps you tell multiple groups of the same type apart. The colors below match the stickers provided in your core game."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_TRACKING,"Even though this tutorial will tell you where to place and move figures at times, this is for demonstration purposes only. During a typical mission, the app does not track where any figures, Rebel or Imperial, are on the map."
TUT_VET_TROOPER_ICON,"This icon represents the group of Stormtroopers. The colored ring around the group matches the color you picked for the group to help you identify which figures belong to this group. You can select this icon to find out more information about this group."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS,"[i]""Blast! How did we not detect them before now? No time to worry about that, you have to get ready for combat!""[/i]\n\nThe Stormtroopers interrupt to activate."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_ACT,"Imperial figures activate in groups. When a group activates, each figure takes its activation one at a time until all of the figures in the group have activated. Then it will be your chance to fight back!"
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_IMP_ACT_WINDOW,"This is the Imperial activation window. A group of Stormtroopers is activating now, so this window shows you everything you need to know to activate them. The colored bar indicates which group is activating in case there are multiple enemy groups of the same type on the map."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_INFO_LINK,"If you select the group’s portrait, you can bring up a list of information relating to this group. You can also access this window through the group’s icon on the right side of the screen. Select the Stormtrooper portrait to continue."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_INFO_WINDOW,"This window shows you any special rules for this group, including any abilities on the group’s Deployment card that should be ignored. For example, this Stormtrooper group (and all Stormtrooper groups) ignores the [b]Squad Training[/b] ability on its card. When playing [i]Star Wars: Imperial Assault—Legends of the Alliance[/i], [b]all[/b] abilities on Imperial groups that use the word ‘may’ or ‘choose’ are ignored because there is no Imperial player to choose when and if to use them.\n\nSelect anywhere on the screen to close the group info window."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_BONUS,"This is a bonus that this group gets during its activation. In this case, each Stormtrooper will apply +1 to its attack during this activation. This bonus may be different each time this group activates, so remember to check it each time."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_INSTR,"Imperial figures act according to a list of orders. One at a time, each figure in the group will perform each of its activation instructions in order, starting from the top. If they cannot perform an order, they will skip it and move to the next one."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_INSTR_2,"Some activation instructions have action icons ( or ) next to them. An Imperial figure can perform instructions with a combined total of two action icons during its activation.\n\nAdditionally, Imperial figures can perform only one instruction that includes an attack action icon ()."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A,"Normally you decide the order that figures in an Imperial group activate, but for the purpose of this tutorial, let’s start with the highlighted Stormtrooper."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_INSTR,"The first instruction these Stormtroopers have is:\n"" [b]Move 3[/b] to [b]attack[/b] « the closest Rebel ».""\nThe first part of this instruction, ""[b]move 3[/b],"" indicates that this Stormtrooper will spend up to 3 movement points to try to perform the rest of the instruction.\n\nWhen a figure moves to attack, it will spend its movement points to get as close as possible to its target before attacking."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_SHORTEST_PATH,"When an Imperial figure moves, it will take the shortest path to reach its destination."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A1,"This Stormtrooper has only one valid place to stop, the highlighted space. This space is as close as the Stormtrooper can get to the closest Rebel, {0}, with its 3 movement points.\n\nMove this Stormtrooper to the indicated space."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_ATTACK,"Now the Stormtrooper will perform an attack against the hero it is closest to, in this case {0}. Use the Stormtrooper card you placed on the table to see which attack dice the Stormtrooper rolls. Roll those dice (1 blue and 1 green), along with {0}’s defense die, if any."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_ATTACK2,"As with any ranged attack, check to see if the attack has sufficient Accuracy to hit. Then the Stormtrooper will spend any surges it rolled, including the free surge it received from its bonus."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_SURGE,"For each surge the Stormtrooper rolled, consult the Surge Priority list by selecting the  Priority button. Selecting the button again will close the Surge Priority list.\n\nThe Stormtrooper will spend its surges on the topmost surge ability that would have an effect on the attack. In this case, the top surge ability is +2 Accuracy. Since the attack already has sufficient Accuracy to hit its target, the Stormtrooper will skip that surge ability and use the next one for +1."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_SURGE2,"Even if the Stormtrooper has two or more uncanceled surges for this attack, it will only use one, because the Stormtrooper only has one surge ability that would have any effect on the attack. (Each surge ability can only be used once per attack.)\n\nFinish the attack by placing any damage taken on the target hero."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_ACTIONS,"It is important to note that even though the Stormtrooper has moved and attacked, it has still only performed one action during its activation because the instruction that was performed had only a single action icon.\n\nIf an instruction is preceded by two action icons ( or ), that instruction takes both of the figure’s actions and will be the only instruction the enemy can perform for its activation."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_ATTACK_LIM,"Remember, since the Stormtrooper performed an attack (indicated by the  icon), it cannot perform another instruction with an attack because Imperial figures are limited to one attack per activation."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_MOVE,"This Stormtrooper has one action remaining, so let’s see what it will do next. We go to the next instruction in the list:\n"" [b]Move 2[/b] to [b]reposition 4[/b].""\nLet’s take a look at the map to see what that means."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_REPO,"""[b]Reposition 4[/b]"" means that the figure will attempt to move to a space from which the nearest Rebel figure is 4 spaces away. Figures will always attempt to perform this action, even if the figure cannot get 4 spaces away.\n\nThe highlighted spaces are all 3 spaces away from {0}, which is the farthest the Stormtrooper can get from that hero."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_REPO2,"Note that while these two spaces are 3 spaces away from {0}, they are only 2 spaces away from {1}. This Stormtrooper wants to be as close to 4 spaces away from both {0} and {1} as possible, so it will not move to either of these spaces."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_REPO3,"These two spaces are 3 spaces from {0}, and at least 4 spaces away from all other heroes, so these two spaces are equally valid for the Stormtrooper to reposition to. So which one will the Stormtrooper move to? This is a case where the [b]Imperial Rule[/b] applies."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_REPO4,"When there are two or more valid options for an Imperial figure, the players as a group should decide which option is least beneficial to the heroes and choose that option. This is known as the [b]Imperial Rule[/b]. However, there’s no time for indecision in combat, so if multiple options are roughly equal in their disadvantages for the heroes, or if the players cannot agree, just pick one at random."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_REPO5,"In this case, the indicated space is slightly better for the Stormtrooper, because it puts the trooper out of the heroes’ line of sight. Move the Stormtrooper to this space."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_A_DONE,"This Stormtrooper has finished its activation, so now the other two will activate."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_B,"Let’s activate this Stormtrooper next. It has the same instructions as the previous one, so its first instruction is:\n"" [b]Move 3[/b] to [b]attack[/b] « the closest Rebel »."""
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_B1,"The Stormtrooper wants to get as close as possible to its target, so it will move to this space.\n\nMove the Stormtrooper to the indicated space."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_B_ATTACK,"Now the Stormtrooper will attack the closest Rebel. Since there is more than one Rebel equally close to the Stormtrooper, you will need to decide which one gets attacked. Don’t forget the Imperial Rule! Then perform the attack as before.\n\nPerform an attack against a hero, and then select ""Continue."""
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_B_ATTACK_2P,"Now the Stormtrooper will attack the closest Rebel. Perform the attack as before.\n\nPerform an attack against {0}, and then select ""Continue."""
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_B_MOVE,"Now that the Stormtrooper has completed that instruction, it is time for its next action:\n"" [b]Move 2[/b] to [b]reposition 4[/b]."""
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_B_REPO,"The Stormtrooper will try to get to a space that is 4 spaces from the nearest Rebel. It cannot do that, but it can get 3 spaces away. The spaces it can reach are highlighted on the map.\n\nChoose the space that seems the least advantageous for the heroes, or pick one at random, and move the Stormtrooper to that space."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_B_REPO_4P,"The Stormtrooper will try to get to a space that is 4 spaces from the nearest Rebel. The highlighted space is at least 3 spaces from each hero, so it is the best option for the Stormtrooper. Move the Stormtrooper to that space."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_C,"Finally, it’s time for the last Stormtrooper to activate. You now have the knowledge you need to activate the last Stormtrooper in this group. If you need to see something on the map, you can use the ""View Map"" button below to minimize the Imperial activation window. Select the ""Activation"" button that appears to reopen the activation window.\n\nActivate the last Stormtrooper, and then select ""Finish."""
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_C_DONE,"Did the third Stormtrooper end its activation in one of the highlighted spaces? If so, then you got everything right, especially if it ended up behind that wreckage. Now it’s time to fight back!"
TUT_VET_OBJECTIVE_TROOPERS,"Defeat the Stormtrooper group."
TUT_VET_TROOPERS_DONE,"Finally, notice that the Stormtrooper portrait on the right side of the screen is tinted red. This indicates that the Stormtrooper group has activated, and it won’t be able to activate again until next round, so it’s all up to the heroes now! Choose a hero to go first and have that hero perform an activation.\n\nWhen the activation is complete, select the hero’s portrait on the left side of the screen to end the hero’s activation."

TUT_VET_PROBE_P1,"This is the best spot for the Probe Droid to attack from that it can reach with its [b]move 2[/b] instruction, so place the activating Probe Droid here. Then determine if the Probe Droid can get line of sight to the hero that has suffered the least . If two or more heroes are tied, break the tie in favor of attacking the hero that is closest. If there is still a tie, choose one hero according to the Imperial Rule."
TUT_VET_PROBE_TARGET,"Let’s take a moment and talk about targeting priority. The « » symbols indicate the priority target for the attack.\n\nWhen an Imperial figure is given some criteria to determine its target, it will try to attack the target that best fits that criteria. If it cannot attack that target for any reason, it will instead choose from the targets that it can attack the one that best fits the criteria. Finally, if it cannot attack a target that fits the criteria, it will default to attacking the closest Rebel figure."
TUT_VET_PROBE_TARGET2,"Assume for a moment that the Probe Droid cannot get line of sight to the hero who has suffered the least . According to its targeting priority, it will attack the hero that it does have line of sight to that has suffered the least . If it has line of sight to more than one hero with the same amount of , it will attack the closest hero that has suffered the least ."

One of them wears a black cloak and wields a red lightsaber. The Imperials take blaster fire from behind, which the cloaked figure deflects with ease.

TUT_VET_ROYAL_GUARDS_2,"Their first priority is to attack. Fortunately, even if they [b]move 4[/b], they won’t be able to attack anyone. That being the case, they will skip that instruction, including the [b]move[/b] portion."
TUT_VET_ROYAL_GUARDS_3,"Next they will try to protect vulnerable Imperial figures by getting next to them to utilize the guards’ [b]Protector[/b] ability. When a figure is instructed to [b]engage[/b] something, it will try to get adjacent to that thing. In this case, the Royal Guards want to get adjacent to as many non-Guardian Imperial figures as possible, and they will use the [b]move[/b] keyword to do so. If a figure is instructed to engage something that it cannot get adjacent to with the movement points provided, it will skip that instruction.\n\nSince both Royal Guard figures are Guardians, they will not [b]engage[/b] each other, and there are no other Imperial figures within a [b]move 3[/b] of them. This means that instruction will be skipped as well."
TUT_VET_ROYAL_GUARDS_4,"With their plans thwarted, they will just try to get into position to attack next round. Their next instruction is to [b]move 3[/b] toward Rebels, targeting the closest non-ready hero. They will move toward the closest hero that has no activations remaining this round. If there is no such hero, targeting priority dictates that they will move toward the closest Rebel figure."
TUT_VET_ROYAL_GUARDS_5,"After a guard has executed the [b]move 3[/b] instruction, it will go to the next instruction, moving it even closer to its target.\n\nPerform the activation for this Royal Guard group.

TUT_VET_MED_PACKS_1,"When playing [i]Star Wars: Imperial Assault—Legends of the Alliance[/i], heroes do not recover  when they would recover more  than they have on their Hero sheet. That extra recovery has no effect. This means no more recovering  when you take a rest action. If you have recovered  during this mission by resting, don’t worry about it. Just play with this new rule from now on. Any abilities you have that allow you to recover  specifically still work as normal."
TUT_VET_MED_PACKS_2,"Instead of recovering  when you rest, you can now spend medpacs to recover . A hero can spend a medpac when performing a rest action to recover 5. An ally can spend an action during its activation to use a medpac to recover 5.\n\nTo use a medpac, select the Medpacs button highlighted below."
TUT_VET_MED_PACKS_3,"Medpacs are in short supply for the Rebellion, so you better use them wisely.
